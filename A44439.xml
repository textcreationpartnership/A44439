            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>A Sermon of <hi>Death</hi> hath then a double Advantage to make deep impreſſions upon us,<note place="margin">An Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</note> when it is attended with a Spectacle of <hi>Mortality:</hi> Were there but the ſad Pomp of a <hi>Funeral</hi> now preſented before you, a dead Corpſe brought to be interred, a Grave digged through into the Earth, dry and rotten Bones lying ſcattered about the Mouth of it in fearful confuſion, a ſolemn Train
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105935:11"/> of Mourners tolled along the Streets by the doleful Moan of a Bell? Did you ſee the Dead laid down in the Duſt, the Place of Darkneſs and Silence, their Friends groaning out their laſt Farewell, Clods of Earth falling in upon them, and ſtriking a horrid murmur upon their Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fins: Had your Affections but ſuch a Preparatory as this is, poſſibly this might more eaſily work and move upon them; for it muſt needs make Men ſerious and penſive to think, this is but the Pattern of what muſt befall themſelves, and that all this muſt ſhortly be acted upon them, that they now ſee done unto others: But ſince this Day preſents us with no ſuch <hi>Solemnity,</hi> ſome perhaps may wonder that I have choſen this <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> of <hi>Mortality</hi> to treat upon. Indeed Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom hath made it almoſt improper to preach of <hi>Death</hi> without a <hi>Funeral,</hi> and to ſpeak to Men of their laſt End and Diſſolution, without ſetting before their Eyes an Example of it: Look well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one upon another; what are we all as it were, but ſo many Corpſes, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Spectacles of <hi>Mortality,</hi> rather to be numbred among the Dead than among the Living; every Day and Hour wears
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105935:11"/> away part of our Lives; and ſo much of them as is already ſpent, ſo far are we already dead and buried. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moment is the longeſt meaſure of our Lives; what is paſt is dead to us, and what is to come is not yet born, how ſoon God may put a final Period to our preſent ſtate, how few times more our Pulſes may beat, and this buſie Breath in our Noſtrils return to us again, we know not; ſo frail and ſo uncertain are our Lives, that this may be truly a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sermon to ſome one of us before the cloſe of it. Since then we are all of us thus ſubject to the ſtroke of <hi>Death,</hi> it can never be unſeaſonable to warn you, that you be not ſurprized, and taken by it unprovided.</p>
                  <p>In the Words now read, you have the great Statute-Law of Heaven; that Law that God hath paſſed upon all the Chil-of Men; and that is, <hi>That it is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them once to die.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, that I may make way to preſs upon you the ſerious conſideration of your own <hi>Mortality,</hi> let me briefly mark
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105935:12"/> out ſome things that tend to the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Words. And,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> In that the Propoſition is laid down in the <hi>Text</hi> indefinitely, <hi>It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto men;</hi> it is that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent to an Univerſal, and reacheth to all men; <hi>It is appointed to all men once to die.</hi> We read of two only in the whole Book of God that were exempted by an extraordinary Grace, and peculiar Priviledge from this great Law of Dying, and they were <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi> Of <hi>Enoch</hi> it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 5.24.</note> 
                     <hi>That he walked with God, and he was not; for God took him.</hi> And of <hi>Elias</hi> it is ſaid,<note place="margin">2 Kin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2.11.</note> 
                     <hi>That he went up by a Whirlwind into Heaven.</hi> The great God, after a ſtrange and unuſual manner tackt their temporal and eternal Life together, making their Time run it ſelf into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity without any period or interruption. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> alſo tells us,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.51, 52.</note> That <hi>all ſhall not die;</hi> to wit, at the laſt Day, at the laſt appearing of Jeſus Chriſt, there ſhall be a World full of Perſons that ſhall not taſte of <hi>Death. All ſhall not die; but all ſhall be changed, in a moment, in the twinckling of an Eye.</hi> Theſe are exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and being excepted, it is certain all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105935:12"/> the Generations of Men, from the firſt Creation, to the laſt Conſummation of all things, are <hi>all appointed</hi> by God unto <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, All muſt die once.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">All muſt die once; but Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers do not die the ſecond Death.</note> There is frequent mention made in <hi>Scripture</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond Death.</hi> The <hi>firſt Death</hi> is the ſeparation of the Soul from the Body: The <hi>ſecond Death</hi> is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Soul from God. As the Union of the Soul and Body is the Life of Man; ſo the Union of God with the Soul, is the Life of the Soul. Now Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers do not die this <hi>ſecond Death;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 20.8.</note> 
                     <hi>for on ſuch,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Death hath no power:</hi> They are ſtill united unto God after an unconceivable and ineffable manner. As when Chriſt lay in the Grave, though his Soul was truly ſeparated from his Body, yet both Soul and Body were hypoſtatically uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Godhead; ſo alſo, though the natural Union between a Believer's Soul and Body, be diſſolved by <hi>Death,</hi> yet both Soul and Body continue myſtically united unto Chriſt, even in their ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one from another. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this <hi>ſecond,</hi> but the <hi>firſt Death</hi> that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105935:13"/> all are appointed unto. The Hand of <hi>Death</hi> muſt untie thoſe ſecret and ſweet Bands, thoſe vital Knots that faſten Soul and Body together, muſt fall aſunder one day in every Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">All Men muſt die, becauſe Death is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Sin.</note>
                     <hi>Thirdly, It is appointed unto every Man to undergo this firſt Death.</hi> It is decreed and ordained by God, and that not upon the Account of any natural Neceſſity; but for the Puniſhment of Sin. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us plainly, That <hi>by Sin Death entred into the World. Death</hi> therefore is not ſo much a Debt due to Nature, as a Debt due to the avenging Juſtice of God; for though Man at firſt was created in pure Nature, yet was he alſo created in a deathleſs State; and <hi>Death</hi> ſiezeth upon us, not as we are Men, but as we are Sinners, liable to the Curſe of the Covenant of Works, containing in it that Threatning, <hi>In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> It is true, <hi>Adam,</hi> even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſinned, had in him the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the ſame contrary Qualities that we now have; and ſo, at leaſt, had alſo the remote Principles of <hi>Death;</hi> but yet it is probable that he was created
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105935:13"/> with ſuch a Priviledge, that he might by his own Will ſway and over-rule the Jars and Diſcords of his elementary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and continue himſelf in Life as long as he ſhould continue himſelf in Obedience; however, whether it was ſo, or otherwiſe, yet certain it is that <hi>Death</hi> came into the World as the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Sin: So then it is not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily Man's Nature, but Man's Sin, and the Curſe of the Law taking hold of him, that brought in this neceſſity of dying. Sin is not only the Sting, but the Cauſe of <hi>Death;</hi> and it gives it not only its Terrour, but its very Being alſo. And therefore it is ſomewhat remarkable, that among all the Creatures in the World, Man only is termed <hi>Mortal;</hi> moſt certain it is that other Creatures decay and periſh as well as he; yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all periſhing things, Man only hath that wretched denomination of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mortal;</hi> and there is good reaſon for it, ſince he alone, of all periſhing things, being created <hi>immortal,</hi> volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſubjected himſelf unto <hi>Death,</hi> and by his own Fault brought upon himſelf that Name of <hi>Mortal,</hi> as a Brand of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Infamy.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:105935:14"/>
                  <p>And thus now I come to the Subject that I intend to inſiſt upon, and that is, The Unavoidableneſs and Certainty of <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To go about to prove this, were to loſe ſo much time; every one grants he muſt die. All other <hi>Questions</hi> about Man, are anſwered by <hi>Peradventures:</hi> If it be demanded, Whether ſuch an <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo</hi> ſhall ſee the Light? What's the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> but, perhaps it ſhall, perhaps it ſhall not: If it be born, and it be asked, Whether it ſhall live, and grow up to Age? Why, perhaps ſo, perhaps other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: If it grow up to Age, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry be made, Shall it be rich, or ſhall it be poor? honourable, or deſpiſed? learned, or ignorant? What's the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer?</hi> Only, perhaps it ſhall, perhaps not. But if it be asked, Whether it ſhall die? The <hi>Anſwer</hi> now is, Yes; it is certain, without any <hi>Peradventure;</hi> there is no doubt at all of this; <hi>It is appointed by God for Men once to die.</hi> And therefore though <hi>Phyſicians</hi> have written Books of preſerving of Health, yet never any wrote Books of avoiding of <hi>Death.</hi> We need no other proof of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105935:14"/> Man's <hi>Mortality,</hi> but only to ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Records of the Grave; there lie Rich and Poor, Strong and Weak, Wiſe and Fooliſh, Holy and Prophane; the Rubbiſh of ten thouſand Generations heaped one upon another, and this Truth that all muſt die, written indelibly in their Duſt.</p>
                  <p>That therefore that I ſhall do, ſhall be in an Applicatory Way, to make ſome Reflections upon the brutiſh Stupidity of Men, who, though they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Mortal,</hi> yet thruſt from themſelves the Thoughts of <hi>Death,</hi> and neglect due Preparations for it. Men live in the World as if they were arbitrary of their own Time, as if they ſhould never die and come to Judgment. Oh the beaſtly Sottiſhneſs of Men, who, though they ſee Multitudes cut down daily by the hand of <hi>Death,</hi> round about them, yet they live careleſly and preſumptuouſly, as if they were priviledged Perſons, and <hi>Death</hi> durſt not touch them. Should we make Enquiry into the Cauſes of this groſs Stupidity and Sottiſhneſs, perhaps we ſhould find it to proceed from ſome of theſe following.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:105935:15"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Reaſons why men put off the thoughts of Death. Becauſe they are drown'd in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the World.</note>Firſt, <hi>The generality of men are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd and drowned in the Affairs and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Life, that all ſerious thoughts of Death and preparations for it are ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up and devoured by them:</hi> Their minds are taken up about other things, and their time ſpent upon other matters; like an heap of <hi>Ants</hi> that buſily toil to gather in their Proviſion, not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the foot that is ready to tread upon them; ſo is it with moſt men, they are taken up with impertinencies and vain things: One contrives how he may melt away his days in Luxury and Pleaſure, and with variety of invented Delights imp the wings of time that in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions makes but ſlow haſt, that ſo their days and hours may roll away the faſter; theſe are ſuch Prodigals of their time, and laviſh it away at that rate, as if their ſtock would laſt as long as Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity it ſelf. Some are buſily climbing up the ſleep aſcent of Honour and Dignity, and are ſo taken up in ſeeking after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions and new Titles that they forget their old ſtile of mortal creatures. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are plotting with the <hi>Fool</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> how they may grow rich, and lay up goods for themſelves for many
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105935:15"/> years as they fanſie, when yet they know not but God may take away their Souls from them this very night; and what then remains to them of all that they have thus greedily ſcraped together. O vain and fooliſh men, are theſe the things you ſet your hearts upon; muſt the World drink up all your thoughts, and <hi>Death</hi> that ſhortly will ſnatch you from all your enjoyments here below be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by you.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Men put off their preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they look upon it as a far off.</note> 
                     <hi>Men put off the thoughts of Death and their preparations for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they generally look upon it as a far off.</hi> This is the greateſt ſottiſhneſs in the World, and yet moſt men are too guilty of it. Thoſe that are young and in the prime of their Days; if it be askt them what they think of <hi>Death,</hi> they will readily <hi>Anſwer,</hi> that they think they ought of right and courſe to live till they are aged: And they that are aged will tell you their weakneſſes and decays are not ſo many or ſo great, but they may well weather away a few more years. Thoſe that are healthful and ſtrong think ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they need not prepare for dying till God by ſome ſickneſs ſends them a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105935:16"/> and thoſe whom God is pleaſed to vouchſafe a ſummons by Sickneſs and Diſtempers, alas they think that it is yet poſſible for them to eſcape from them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. And thus all are ready to thruſt Death from them, and to put the Evil Day a far off: And though God hath told out to them but a few days or hours, yet they liberally and bountifully reckon upon Years and Ages, as if their time were not in God's hands but their own. It is a true ſaying, that uſually the hopes of a long Life, is the Cauſe of an Evil Life. Suppoſe now that every one of us knew for a certainty that our lives muſt run out with the Glaſs that is before us, that at the end of the hour God would ſtrike us all dead upon the place, ſhould we not all of us have more lively appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Death and Eternity than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet we have had; ſhould we not pour out our Souls before God requires them from us in holy Affections and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayers; ſhould we give ſcope to the gaddings of our Thoughts, and the vanity of our Hearts; ſhould we think of ſuch a vain Pleaſure, or ſuch a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Employment, if God now from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhould ſpeak audibly to us and bid us
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105935:16"/> give an account of our Stewardſhip, for we muſt be no longer Stewards, no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is impoſſible that men ſhould thus behave themſelves: And why, Sirs, is it not ſo with you always, for ought you know that Film and Bubble that holds your Lives, may be now a break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, your Graves may be ready to be digging, and the laſt Sand in your Glaſs may be now a running; however certain it is, it cannot be long before it will be ſo with all of us: Did we but ſeriouſly conſider by what ſmall pins this frame of Man is tacked together, it would appear to us to be no leſs than a Miracle that we live one day, yea one hour to an end.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The thoughts of Death being teri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, makes men put off their preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it.</note> 
                     <hi>Men generally put off the thoughts of Death and their preparation for it, becauſe of thoſe frightful terrors, and that inſupportable dread that ſuch apprehenſions bring with them.</hi> Death is that which above all things Humane Nature moſt abhors: Oh! to think of the ſeparation of thoſe near and dear companions, the Soul and Body, of the debaſement, diſhonour and horrour of the Grave, that there we muſt lie in a Bed of ſtench and rottenneſs under a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105935:17"/> coverlet of Worms crawling upon us, conſuming and mouldring away to duſt in oblivion and forgetfulneſs: Oh! theſe are too ſad and Melancholy Thoughts for the Jovial World to entertain and dwell upon: But though the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe things are very unwelcome, yea, very diſmal unto the minds of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet is there far worſe behind then all this ſtill, and that which carries in it far greater terrour and amazement, and that is the ſin that deſerves <hi>Death,</hi> and the Hell that follows it, for as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.56.</note> 
                     <hi>the ſting of Death is ſin.</hi> And its no wonder that Men who are conſcious to themſelves of condemning guilt, dare not think of ſtanding before the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tribunal of God; and Death now is God's Serjeant to Arreſt them and to bring them thither, they cannot bear the thoughts of Eternal Vengeance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Torments to be for ever inflicted on them by the Almighty Power of an incenſed God, and therefore it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they put far from them the thoughts of <hi>Death,</hi> becauſe their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences tell them that that Day whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it comes will be to them an Evil Day.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:105935:17"/>
                  <p>Many more <hi>Reaſons</hi> might be given of this brutiſhneſs of men in putting off the thoughts of Death and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for it, but theſe ſhall ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>The next thing that I ſhall do ſhall be to lay down ſome Conſiderations that may fore-arm Chriſtians againſt the Fears and Terrours of Death,<note place="margin">Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to arm men againſt the fears of Death.</note> and make them willing to ſubmit unto this law of Dying, unto which God hath ſubjected all men.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt,<note place="margin">The ſoul is immortal, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into a better life.</note> 
                     <hi>If the Soul be immortal as certainly it is, and that parting from this, it enters upon a better Life than this, we may well then be contented to Die upon that account.</hi> No man ſays a <hi>Roman</hi> Author thinks <hi>Death</hi> is much to be avoided, ſince Immortality follows <hi>Death.</hi> I am very ſenſible how hard a task it is to perſwade men to be willing to Die, but yet let me ask you, if you are believers, (for in this I ſpeak only unto ſuch) what is there in <hi>Death</hi> that is ſo terrible to you? I know it is monſtrous and full of horrour if we conſider nothing but the Corruption of the Fleſh, the gaſtly pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the ſtiff, cold and grim viſage, the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105935:18"/> diſtorted Eyes and trembling Limbs of Dying Perſons: And afterwards think of the ſtench and filthineſs of the Grave, and laſtly the diſſipation of the viſible part of Man: All theſe Conſiderations make <hi>Death</hi> very terrible and full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to us. But now he that ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der after all this, his ſpiritual &amp; inviſible part, what can he ſee in <hi>Death</hi> that is not very deſirable to him? the Body reſts from its labours, and the Soul enjoys its reward in Heaven. If you are hereby taken away from converſing with men, yet the Soul is elevated to an acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with <hi>Angels,</hi> that is ſtill alive in its own Nature; the Soul lives for ever, being placed above the common Arreſts of <hi>Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We find to this purpoſe after that God had tryed the patience of <hi>Job</hi> by the loſs of all his ſubſtance, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of all his Children alſo, he reſtores to him double whatever he had taken from him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job</hi> 42.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>0.</note> ſo we read in the Holy Story, <hi>the Lord gave unto</hi> Job <hi>twice as much as he had before.</hi> Now whereas at firſt <hi>Job</hi> had three thouſand Camels, God reſtores to him ſix thouſand; whereas before he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105935:18"/> had ſeven thouſand Sheep, God reſtores to him fourteen thouſand; and ſo of all the reſt double the number of what he loſt: But when God comes to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence to him the loſs of his Children, which doubtleſs were of far greater va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue than all the reſt; whereas he had ſeven Sons and three Daughters, God reſtores to him the ſame number again, not double in theſe as he did in all the reſt: And wherefore did God double his Camels, his Sheep, and his Oxen, and not his Children? why, the <hi>Reaſon</hi> was, becauſe his Children were not ſo dead as were his Camels, and the reſt of his brute Creatures, their Souls remain'd Immortal and Entire ſtill after <hi>Death:</hi> So that God in giving <hi>Job</hi> ſeven Sons and three Daughters did double them, notwithſtanding, though he gave him no more than he had at firſt. So here though we Die, yet <hi>Death</hi> doth us no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; our better part ſurvives, and if we are Believers, it ſurvives in ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Joys, as that all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the World, are but Miſery and Wretchedneſs compared to them.</p>

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105935:19"/> a-kin: When we are aſleep, we ſee not, we hear not, all our Senſes are lock'd up from the enjoyment of any worldly Delights; we take no comfort in our Friends, in our Riches, or Eſtates; all theſe are cancell'd out of our Minds: and what more doth <hi>Death</hi> do than cancel theſe things out of Men's Memories? And yet the weary Labourer lays him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down with contentment, to take his Sleep until the Morning; and why may not we alſo lay down our ſelves with the ſame peace and contentment in our Graves, to take our Reſt and Sleep until the Morning of the Reſurrection? Indeed the Sleep of Death is different from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sleep, ſince that deprives us of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Light; but this Sleep of Death brings us to the viſion of true inacceſſible Light. What then is there in <hi>death,</hi> that we ſhould ſtand in dread of it? Why ſhould that be feared by thoſe for whom the ſting of it is already taken out? Such may ſafely take this <hi>Serpent</hi> into their boſoms; for though it hiſs at them, yet it cannot wound or hurt them; nay, inſtead of wounding them, it is reconciled to them, and become one of their party.

Happy were it for us if either <hi>Sermons</hi> or <hi>Examples</hi> might awaken us to a ſerious Conſideration that we our ſelves alſo muſt ſhortly <hi>die,</hi> and it may be, as ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly. Are we not all ſubjected to the ſame Attack? Hath not God's Hands kneaded our Bodies out of the ſame clay, and may not his Fingers crumble them again into the ſame duſt? Certainly the Cords of our Tabernacles may be as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily unlooſed and cut aſunder as theirs. I have read of a great <hi>Emperour,</hi> that to engrave upon himſelf the deeper Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of his own Frailty and Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, cauſed his own <hi>Funerals</hi> to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniz'd while he was yet living, laying
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105935:21"/> himſelf down in his Tomb, weeping o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelf, as his own Mourner: If there were any advantage in this to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare him to die at laſt really, by dying thus firſt in an Emblem, we may almoſt daily have the ſame. There's not a <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> of any of our Relations or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance that we are called to give our Attendance upon, but by ſerious and ſolemn Reflections upon our ſelves, we may make it our own: and if by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding others nailed up in their <hi>Coffins,</hi> laid down in their cold <hi>Graves,</hi> covered over with Earth, that they may become a Feaſt for Worms; if now we reckon our ſelves among the number of them, we ſhall not be very much miſtaken; for this is only but a few days to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate what ſhall ſhortly be our ſtate and condition. This Advantage we our ſelves may make of the <hi>Death</hi> of others, to look upon it as a reſemblance at leaſt of our own. What is the Language of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Grave</hi> we ſee open its mouth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive into it the dead Body of ſome Neighbour or Acquaintance, but only this, That we alſo are mortal and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing? There's not a broken Skull, or a rotten Bone that lies ſcattered about
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:105935:21"/> the Grave, but hath <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Mortality</hi> written upon them, and call loudly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to prepare our ſelves to take up our Abode in the ſame darkneſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption with them; and if upon every ſuch ſad occaſion we do not make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Application thereof unto our own ſelves, we not only loſe our Friend's <hi>Lives,</hi> but their very <hi>Deaths</hi> alſo. And yet in this Affair, that might be of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to us, we are exceeding faulty; for the reflections we make on the <hi>death</hi> of others, are uſually very impertinent, and make no laſting impreſſions upon us. When <hi>Death</hi> comes and mows down our Acquaintance and Relations round about us, the Reflection that we uſually make, is more upon the Loſs that we have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained by their <hi>Death,</hi> than upon the Example they are thereby made to us of our own Frailty and Mortality; and thereby, as God by his Providence hath deprived us of the Comfort we had in their Lives, ſo we deprive our ſelves of the Inſtruction and Benefit we might have by their Death. Or if ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Circumſtance that appears in the <hi>Death</hi> of others, ſtrikes us into ſerious Thoughts of our own; yet uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105935:22"/> they are but ſhort-liv'd and fleeting; for a while, it may be, we think of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane frailty, and the mutability of our preſent State; but theſe Thoughts ſoon wear off, and we return to the ſame Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and wretched Security as before; for ſuch dying Meditations of Death, are uſually very unprofitable. It is with moſt men as it is with a Flock of Sheep that graze fearleſly till the Shepherd ruſheth in among them, and lays hold of one of them for the Slaughter, and this preſently frights them, making them leave their Food, and run ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Field; but no ſooner is the Tumult over, but they flock together again, and feed as ſecurely, without Thoughts of death or danger as before. So truly is it with moſt men, when ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the report is ſpread abroad that ſuch or ſuch a perſon is dead, and it may be ſuddenly, by ſome ſudden and unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtroke, or when they are called to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit ſome dying Perſon, where they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold departing Pangs, diſtorted Eyes, quivering Limbs, wan and ghaſtly Corpſe, the Image of Death in all its live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terrours; if they have any Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of natural Tenderneſs, it muſt needs
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105935:22"/> ſtrike them into Penſiveneſs, to think that one day this muſt be their own Caſe, and that therefore it behoves them to be in continual preparation for this laſt and dreadful Change: But no ſooner is the Dead interr'd, and the Grave fill'd up again, but all theſe ſage and ſerious Thoughts vaniſh, and they return to the ſame exceſs of Sin and Pleaſure as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: This is the brutiſh Folly and Sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs of moſt men. But Oh, why ſhould not men always keep alive vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thoughts and meditations of <hi>Death!</hi> Are they not always alike mortal? Are they not as much ſubject to the Arreſt of <hi>Death</hi> at other times as when they ſee Examples of Mortality before their Eyes? The Law ſtands ſtill in force, unrepealed in Heaven, <hi>That it is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto all Men once to die.</hi> Indeed it fares with ſuch as theſe, as ordinarily it doth with Malefactors, that fear not the Penalty of the Law till they ſee it exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon others. Let us therefore act rationally as Men, and as long as we are in danger, be kept by that danger pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to entertain that which we know is irreverſibly appointed unto us.</p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:105935:23"/>
                  <p>But now, beſides this general Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, That all ſhall die, there is a particular Appointment, that reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to every particular Circumſtance of Man's Death; the time when, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how we ſhall die: Theſe are unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably determined in God's ſecret Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. To ſpeak a little briefly to this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the time of Man's life. Dan. 5.23.</note>Firſt, <hi>God hath punctually and exactly determined the time of our Death to a very moment.</hi> The great God, <hi>in whoſe hands our Lives, our Breath, and all our Ways are,</hi> he turns up our Glaſs, and puts ſuch a meaſure of Sand into it, and no more; it is he that prefixes it to run to ſuch a length of Time, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines it ſhall run no longer: It is he who is Lord of all Time, that writes our Names upon ſo many Days and Hours as we ſhall live, as upon ſo many Leaves of his Book; and it is impoſſible for us to live one Day or Hour that hath not our Name written upon it by him from all Eternity. It is God that ſets every one the Bounds of their living, as well as <hi>the Bounds of their habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 17.26.</note> beyond which they ſhall not be able to paſs. The <hi>Embryo</hi> that dies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:105935:23"/> ever it ſees the Light, fills up its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time by God, as well as he that lives to decrepit old Age. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though the <hi>Scripture</hi> and we uſe to ſay, Such or ſuch an one is taken away <hi>in the midſt of his days;</hi> yet ſimply in it ſelf conſidered, that is impoſſible; the whole Tale of days that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to every one, muſt be fulfilled, and that to a very moment, according as the number of them is ſet down by God from all eternity. Such Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe denote no more, than either that God cuts them off in the full ſtrength and vigour of their years, when yet they might, according to the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and humane probability, have lived longer; or elſe comparing the ſhortneſs of their Lives with the length of others, God ſeems to break it off in the very midſt, before he had finiſhed his Work. I ſhall not enter into a Diſpute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Term of Life be fixed or move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Methinks <hi>Job</hi> hath fully ſtated and determined the <hi>Queſtion.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 7.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Is there not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>an appointed time to Man upon Earth? Are not his days alſo like the days of an Hireling?</hi> Now an <hi>Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> hath a time of Service prefixed, which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105935:24"/> when it is expired, he is diſcharged from his Labour. God hath ſent all Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World as ſo many <hi>Hirelings,</hi> and as ſoon as theſe days are expired, he takes them from their labour to their reward. Are not my days as the days of an Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? So <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks alſo in another Chapter, concerning Man; <hi>His days are determined,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 14.5.</note> 
                     <hi>the number of his Months are with thee; thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot paſs.</hi> What can be more punctual and particular? It is true how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that though God hath thus num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred out our days, and ſet us our bounds, yet we may well ſay, That whoever dies, might have lived longer, had they made uſe of the right Means: As <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> ſaid unto our Saviour,<note place="margin">Luke 11.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord, if thou hadſt been here my Brother had not died.</hi> So may we ſay, If ſuch and ſuch Means had been uſed, and ſuch Remedies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, this or that Perſon had not died; but withal we muſt obſerve alſo, that, that God who hath prefixed to every one his Term of Life, hath alſo ordained in his own Counſel and Purpoſe, that thoſe Means that are proper to prolong Life beyond that Term, ſhould through ſome unavoidable miſtake or miſhap, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:105935:24"/> not be known, or not uſed. This therefore may be of great ſupport unto us, as againſt all inordinate Fears of our own <hi>Death;</hi> ſo againſt all inordinate grief and ſorrow for the <hi>Death</hi> of others; to conſider that all our Times are in God's hands; he meaſures out every day to us; and as he hath appointed bounds to us, beyond which we ſhall not paſs, ſo alſo hath he appointed that we ſhall certainly reach unto thoſe bounds. His all wiſe Providence diſpoſeth of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and ſmalleſt Concernments of our Lives, and therefore much more of our Lives themſelves; and if a <hi>Hair of our Heads</hi> cannot, much leſs ſhall not we our ſelves fall to the ground without our Heavenly Father.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As God hath appointed the exact critical Hour, ſo alſo the particular Manner of our Death.</hi> It is he that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points whether it ſhall be ſudden or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen; by Diſeaſes, or by Caſualty; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Thred of our Life ſhall be ſnapt in pieces by ſome unexpected Accident, or worn and fretted away by ſome tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and lingring Conſumption, or burnt aſunder by ſome fiery Fever. In what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105935:25"/> manner or ſhape <hi>Death</hi> may appear to us, is a Secret known only unto God; but this we know that it is always his Serjeant, and wears his Livery; and all the Circumſtances of our <hi>Death</hi> are of God's appointment, as well as our <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf. And in whatever ſhape it ſhall appear to us, if we diligently endeavour by a holy Life to prepare our ſelves for it, it ſhall not be frightful or terrible to us.</p>
                  <p>Now to make ſome Practical Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this. And,</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105935:33"/> comparative inequality in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, is taken from the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Objects about which they are converſant; ſome of them concern our Duty to God, others concern our Duty to Man: Now becauſe Man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely leſs than God, therefore thoſe Commands that relate to our Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Man, may be called leſs than thoſe Commands that relate to our Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. Hence, when the <hi>Lawyer</hi> put a Caſe to our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 22.36.</note> Mat. 22.36. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which is the great Commandment in the Law?</hi> Our <hi>Lord</hi> anſwers him, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind; This,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is the firſt and great Commandment.</hi> Sometimes this inequality riſeth from the Latitude that every Command hath in it: Now this Latitude relateth to our Thoughts, to our Words, and to our Actions. Now becauſe a Thought may be ſaid to be leſs than a Word, and a Word may be ſaid to be leſs than an Action, therefore that part of the Commandment that requires Holineſs in our Thoughts, may be ſaid to be leſs than that which requires Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our Speech; and that part of the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:105935:33"/> Commandment which requires Holineſs in our Speech, than that which requires Holineſs in our Lives and Actions. Now, ſays our Saviour, he that ſins againſt Man, as well as he that ſins againſt G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And thus you ſee what is meant by the <hi>leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing we are to enquire into,<note place="margin">What is meant by being leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</note> is what we are to underſtand by being <hi>leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> By the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> may be meant, either the Kingdom of Grace ſet up in the Church on Earth; and thus the Word is ſo frequently made uſe of in <hi>Scripture,</hi> I need not turn you to any Places. Or elſe by the <hi>Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> may be meant the Kingdom of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, eſtabliſhed in the higheſt Heavens. If we take <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> here in the <hi>Text</hi> for the Kingdom of Grace, that is, for the Church and People of God here on Earth, then the Sence runs thus;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105935:34"/> 
                     <hi>He that breaketh the leaſt Commandment, and teacheth Men ſo,</hi> ſhall be no true Member of the Church of Chriſt. But if we take <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> here ſpoken of, to be the Kingdom of Glory; then the meaning is, <hi>He that breaks the least Commandment ſhall be least in the Kingdom of Heaven;</hi> that is, he ſhall not enter into Heaven at all. <hi>Minimus vocabitur in Regno Coelorum, &amp; fortaſſe ideo non erit in Regno Coelorum, ubi niſi magni eſſe non poſſunt,</hi> as St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſpeaks. He ſhall be the <hi>least</hi> in <hi>Heaven;</hi> that is, he ſhall not be there at all, becauſe in Heaven there are none but great and glorious ones.</p>
                  <p>You ſee then what a heavy and moſt dreadful Doom Chriſt hath paſs'd upon thoſe things that the World call little and trivial Sins; they exclude out of Heaven, and will, without Repentance and a Pardon interpoſe, ſink the Soul down to the loweſt Hell irrecoverably.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe the generality of the World; yea, and of Profeſſors alſo, do too commonly allow and indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>little Sins,</hi> I have therefore
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105935:34"/> made choice of this Subject, on purpoſe, to convince you if it may be of the great evil that lurks under them, and that great wrath that will follow upon them: That as you would out of your great care for your precious and immortal Soul's eternal Welfare, abſtain from the Commiſſion of notorious and ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Sins; ſo you would labour to keep your ſelves free from theſe <hi>little Sins,</hi> which though leſs ſcandalous, yet are they not leſs pernicious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive: And this I ſhall endeavour to do in the Proſecution of this one Propoſition.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>He that breaketh the leaſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Now in treating upon this Subject, becauſe I intend not to inſiſt long upon it, I ſhall only lay down ſome Demonſtrations of the Truth of the Doctrine, and then make ſome Uſe and Application of it.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Therefore the great evil and danger that there is in <hi>little Sins</hi> appears in this, that the leaſt Sin is a moſt high Affront and Provocation of the Great God. An Infinite Holineſs is oppoſed, and an Infinite Juſtice is incenſed by them. Though I am not of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Stoick Philoſophers,</hi> that all Vices are equally hainous; yet this I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count certain, that there is in the leaſt Sin as flat a repugnancy and contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Holy Will of God as in the greateſt. Hath not God forbidden vain Thoughts and idle Words, as ſtrictly as he hath forbidden Murder, Adultery, Blaſphemy, and Hatred of himſelf, with all thoſe abominable Sins that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file the mouths of thoſe that name them? And is it not as much his Will that he ſhould be obey'd in thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as in theſe? Have you any more Diſpenſation in the <hi>Scripture</hi> to ſpeak an idle Word, than you have to bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheme the Name of God?

No certainly; there are no ſuch Diſpenſations can ever be found in the Word of God; and I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, God will never diſpenſe with any Sin farther than he hath revealed; and why then will you dare to diſpenſe with your ſelves more in <hi>little Sins</hi> than in <hi>great Sins?</hi> Oh, our Conſciences will never bear with any patience thoſe great and crying Sins: Will they not? and do you think that God's Holineſs will bear with your <hi>little Sins?</hi> Believe it, theſe <hi>little Sins</hi> do arm God's terrible Power and Vengeance againſt you And as a <hi>Page</hi> may carry the Sword of a great <hi>Warriour</hi> after him, ſo your <hi>little Sins</hi> do, as it were, bear the Sword of God's Juſtice, and put it into his hands againſt you. And wo unto us if the holy and jealous God deal in fury with us for our ſmall Provocations.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Little ſins a violation of the Law of God.</note> Every <hi>little Sin</hi> is a heinous violation of a holy and ſtrict Law that God hath given us to be the Rule of our Lives. The leaſt Sin takes the <hi>two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi>

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That you may ſee what a complicate Evil every Sin is, take this too, which, though it be a Paradox, yet is it a moſt ſad Truth, That the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the leaſt Sin makes you guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the greateſt Sin; yea, guilty of all Sin imaginable. Hear this therefore, and tremble all you that allow your ſelves in vain Thoughts or idle Words, and think with your ſelves, Piſh, this is but a Thought; this is but a Word; no, it is not only a vain Thought, or an idle Word; it is Blaſphemy, it is Hatred of God, it is Murther, it is Adultery, it is Idolatry; you will ſay, this is ſtrange <hi>Doctrine;</hi> if it be, it is the <hi>Apostle's Doctrine,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 2.10.</note> Jam. 2.10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</hi> As therefore thou wouldſt not be found guilty in the great Day of the Lord of all that ever Hell it ſelf was ever impeached for, ſee that you abhor the commiſſion of the leaſt Sin; for the leaſt Sin will involve thy Soul in the greateſt guilt. And the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105935:36"/> Apoſtle gives an evident Reaſon of this, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. <hi>For he that ſaid, Do not commit Adultery, ſaid alſo, Do not kill; now if thou do not commit Adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a tranſgreſſor of the Law.</hi> The worſt thing that can be found in all the Sins that ever were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, is the contempt of God's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Now there is as much wretched contempt of the Authority of the great God, in the commiſſion of <hi>little Sins,</hi> as there is in the commiſſion of <hi>great Sins.</hi> It is the ſame God that ſaith, Do not take my Name in vain, who ſaith, Do not blaſpheme me; the ſame God that ſaith, Do not murther, hath ſaid alſo, Be not angry with thy Brother cauſleſly. Now what is it that makes Blaſphemy and Murther ſuch heinous Sins? Truly the Venom and Rancour of them lies in this, That the Authority of that great God who hath forbidden them, is ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and trampled under foot; and is it not ſo by <hi>ſmall Sins?</hi> Nay, let me add,<note place="margin">God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority more ſligh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle than by great Sins.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Authority of the great God ſeems to be more deſpiſed by the commiſſion of <hi>ſmall Sins,</hi> than by the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:105935:37"/> commiſſion of <hi>great Sins.</hi> Doth it not argue great contempt of God, when you will not obey him in a matter that you your ſelves count ſmall and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable? You think, it may be, it is not of much moment or concernment what your Thoughts be, nor what your Words are; but when you hear and are convinced, that all your Thoughts ſhould be holy, and that all your Diſcourſe ſhould be ſavoury, and ſuch as ſhould miniſter profit and edification unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; if after this, you ſtill think it of no great moment, whether they be vain and frothy, or whether they be holy and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual; believe it, this ſhews you to be deſpiſers of God's dominion and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over you, when his Commands cannot prevail againſt the <hi>least Sin.</hi> What a ſmall Matter was it, may ſome ſay, for <hi>Adam</hi> to eat of an <hi>Apple</hi> in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe?</hi> But was it not as ſmall a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for him to forbear and let it alone?

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:105935:47"/> will ſpread it ſelf into the Life and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; <hi>for out of the abundance of the Heart the Mouth ſpeaketh;</hi> and <hi>evil Words corrupt good Manners.</hi> Sinful Thoughts form themſelves into Words, and Words will conſolidate themſelves into Actions; and then Sin is perfected, and hath attained its full growth: And if you would know what the next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or ſtep is that Sin takes, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> tells you, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.15. <hi>When Luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth Sin; and Sin, when it is perfected, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth Death.</hi> You can no more ſet bounds to your Corruptions, than to the raging Sea; nor ſay to it, <hi>Hitherto ſhall thy proud Waves go and no further.</hi> It were Folly, when you have ſet fire to a Train of Powder, to expect it ſhould ſtop any where ſhort of the utmoſt of it. So truly, when the Thoughts are ſet on fire of <hi>Hell,</hi> this will inflame the Tongue, and that will inflame the Life; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs God's infinite Mercy prevent, this burning will ſtop no where ſhort of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burning. Ask but your own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences this; Have you not often found it ſo? Hath not the <hi>Devil</hi> drill'd you on from <hi>little Sins</hi> to <hi>great Sins,</hi> and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105935:47"/> from theſe, to far greater Abominations? Believe it, there is a bottomleſs deceit in every Sin, and this is the deſperate iſſue of it, that if once you come to account any Sin ſmall, you will ſoon reckon the greateſt Sin to be no more. We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reckon the greatneſs of Sin by the abruptneſs of our advance to it. Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it would ſeem a horrid thing at the firſt riſing of a Temptation in our hearts, if we ſhould preſently perpetrate the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of it into Act; therefore the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Sin is more ſmooth and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; it counts a ſinful Thought a little Tranſgreſſion, and ſinful Diſcourſe to have but a little more guilt in it than a ſinful Thought, and ſinful Actions to have but a little more guilt in them than ſinful Words. A great Sin but in a little degree exceeds a leſs; and ſo comparing Sin with Sin, and not with the <hi>Law,</hi> we at length come by inviſible Advances to look upon the greateſt Impieties in the world to be but <hi>little Sins,</hi> and ſo to commit them. If <hi>Satan</hi> prevails with us to go with him one ſtep out of our way, we are in danger to ſtop no where till we come to the height of all Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he will make us take a ſecond, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:105935:48"/> a third, and ſo to travel on to Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for each of theſe is but one ſtep; the laſt ſtep of Sin is but one ſtep, as well as the firſt; and if the <hi>Devil</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails with us to take one ſtep, why ſhould he not prevail with us to take the laſt ſtep as well as the firſt ſtep, ſeeing it is but one? Your ſecond Sin no more exceeds your firſt, than your firſt doth your Duty; and ſo of the reſt. We ſhould not therefore account any Sin ſmall, but look upon them as the ſpawn of all the vileſt Abominations: And as you would abhor Death and Hell, ſo abhor the leaſt Sin; becauſe it hath a Plot upon us in ſubſerviency to greater Sins, that without infinite Mercy, will certainly bring to, and terminate in Death and Hell.</p>

But now we have no ſuch abhorrency againſt the latter; if the Life be free from groſs Enormities, we look upon <hi>

We may take an eſtimate in what proportion God's dealings with Sinners will be when he comes to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, by obſerving how he deals

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another uſe we may make of this <hi>Doctrine</hi> is this; Is there ſo great an Evil and Danger in <hi>little Sins?</hi> Then here behold a woful Ship-wrack of all the Hopes, and of all the Confidences of <hi>Formaliſts</hi> and <hi>Self-Juſtitiaries,</hi> that hope to appear before God upon the account of their own Innocency and Harmleſneſs. Hence learn that a quiet, civil, honeſt Life, free from groſs and ſcandalous Impieties is no good Plea or Title for Heaven; yet truly this is that alone that the generality, eſpecially of the Ignorant relie upon, their Lives are harmleſs their Dealings upright, none can juſtly challenge them that they have done them any wrong; were they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to appear before God's Judgment-ſeat, they know nothing by themſelves that deſerves Eternal Death; therefore if God ſave any Perſons in the World, ſure they are in the number of them. But is it ſo indeed? What do you know nothing by your ſelves? Had you never ſo much as a Thought in you that ſtept awry? Did you never lodge a Thought in you that had in it the leaſt Vanity, Impertinency, or Frivolouſneſs? Have you never uttered a Word that did ſo much
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:105935:53"/> as liſpe againſt the Holy Law of God? Will you dare to tell God you never yet flid an Action that Innocency it ſelf would be aſhamed to own? Have your Lives in every part been as ſtrict and holy as the Law of God commands them to be? if not, it is in vain to plead for Heaven that your Converſations have been honeſt, civil and harmleſs, or that you have been Religious, and maintained a conſtant Courſe of holy Duties and good Works. I would not here be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken by any as if I were preaching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Morality, or condemning Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and common Honeſty.

When we have therefore confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the more obſervable Failings of every Day, we ought to wrap up the reſt in a general, but yet in a ſerious and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acknowledgment.

Only here take heed that when you thus make your Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of your <hi>ſmall Sins</hi> in general, you do not alſo make them overtly, ſlightly and ſuperficially, which is the common Fault of thoſe that confeſs Sin by the heap.

                     <hi>Firſt, Pray earneſtly for a wiſe and an underſtanding Heart, and for a ſoft and tender Conſcience.</hi> Some Sins ſo Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit an harmleſs appearance, and look ſo innocently, that a Man had need of much ſpiritual Wiſdom, to know how to diſtinguiſh between Good and Evil, and to put a difference between thoſe things, that differ as much as Heaven and Hell do: Now this ariſeth from that great blindneſs and ignorance that is in Mens minds, whereby they cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that great evil and miſchief that lurks under <hi>ſmall Sins,</hi> but are apt to account every thing that is not ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and groſly wicked to be but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different matter: And as their Minds are thus blinded, ſo their Hearts are hardned, that what they ſee and know to be ſinful, yet they will dare to venture upon it: Whence is it elſe that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the World live in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of thoſe that they call <hi>little Sins,</hi> but becauſe their Hearts are hardned, and their Conſciences ſeared, that thoſe Sins that are great enough to Damn them, yet are not great enough to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them. A tender Conſcience is like the <hi>Apple of a mans Eye,</hi> the leaſt duſt
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:105935:58"/> that gets into it afflicts it. No ſurer and better way to know whether our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences begin to grow dead and ſtupid, then to obſerve what impreſſions <hi>ſmall Sins</hi> make upon them. If we are not very careful to avoid all appearance of Evil, and to ſhun whatſoever looks like Sin; if we are not as much troubled at the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of our Thoughts and Words, at the riſing up of ſinful motions and deſires in us, as we have been formerly; we may then conclude our Hearts are hardned, and our Conſciences are ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying; for a tender Conſcience will no more allow of <hi>ſmall</hi> than of <hi>great Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, Labour always to keep alive upon your Hearts awful and reverent Thoughts of God, his Omnipreſence and Omniſcience;</hi> That there is no Sin ſo ſmall but he knows it, though but a Sin in our Thoughts, yet <hi>every Thought of our Hearts is altogether known unto him.</hi> Call to remembrance his infinite Purity and Holineſs whereby he hates every <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Sin,</hi> even with an infinite hatred as well as the greateſt. Think of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er whereby he can, and of his Truth, Juſtice and Severity whereby he will
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:105935:59"/> puniſh every <hi>little Sin</hi> with no leſs than Eternal Deſtruction: And whileſt you thus think of God, indulge your ſelves in <hi>little Sins</hi> if you can. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> gives this very Direction, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Stand in awe and Sin not,</hi> that is of the infinite glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majeſty of God. Have awful thoughts and reverential apprehenſions of God abiding upon your Hearts and that will keep you from ſinning: <hi>Stand in awe and Sin not.</hi> To look upon Sin thorough the Attributes of God, is to look upon it through a Magnifying Glaſs, and thus you may beſt ſee its ugly deformed Nature; this is the beſt way to repreſent the infinite guilt that is in it, and that contrariety that it bears to the Holy Nature of God. And while you thus ſee Sin comparing it with God, even the leaſt Sin muſt appear hainous: And when you are Tempted to any Sin, while you thus think, you may repell a Temptation as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did his <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 39.9.</note> 
                     <hi>How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs and Sin against God:</hi> The World indeed counts it but a <hi>little Sin,</hi> but looking upon it and comparing it with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Purity of God, we muſt cry out, How ſhall we commit this Sin
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:105935:59"/> though accounted little by others, and ſo provoke a great and holy God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Get a more thorough acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Spiritual ſence and meaning of the Law.</hi> This was the cauſe why the <hi>Phariſee</hi> did ſo ſlight the commiſſion of <hi>ſmall Sins;</hi> becauſe he kept himſelf to the Literal Sence of the Law; and ſo, becauſe there he was commanded <hi>not to kill, not to commit Adultery,</hi> and the like, thought, if he did abſtain from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Act of thoſe Sins, he obſerved the Law; yea, and obſerved it ſufficiently. But now the ſpiritual meaning of the Law, that forbids not only the outwar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the ſpiritual Sence of the Law forbids all theſe. Why, now grow more in acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the ſpiritual ſence and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law, and then you will thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſmall Sins, ſuch as the Sins of the Thoughts, of the Deſires, and of the Fancy, and the like, to be no leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Law, than Murder or
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:105935:60"/> Adultery, and other heinous Sins; the Law having as ſtrictly forbid the one as the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and Laſtly, <hi>Beware you compare not Sins among themſelves.</hi> The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of ſome, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Who meaſuring themſelves by themſelves, and comparing themſelves among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were not wiſe.</hi> Truly it is as great a Folly for us to meaſure Sin by Sin, or to compare one Sin with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For as when we meaſure our ſelves with others, our <hi>Pride</hi> is apt to ſuggeſt to us, That ſuch and ſuch are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Perſons in compariſon of us: So, when we meaſure one Sin by another, <hi>Corruption</hi> is apt to ſuggeſt to us, ſuch a Sin is a ſmall and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Sin in compariſon of another Sin; and therefore I may venture upon it. Certainly, if we obſerve it, there are two ſad Events uſually follow upon our comparing Sins among themſelves. Either,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> We make little Sins leſs than they are; or if we are beaten off from ſuch falſe Opinions, by being ſhewn
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:105935:60"/> how great an Evil there is in them, then,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We make it as good to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the greateſt Sin as the leaſt. Theſe two ſad Events always happen, if we compare one Sin with another. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare not therefore Sin with it ſelf; but compare Sin with thy Duty; compare the <hi>leaſt Sin</hi> with the Holineſs of that God againſt whom thou committeſt it; and this is the way whereby you may be brought to <hi>account no Sin</hi> to be ſmall or <hi>little.</hi>

                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:105935:65"/> the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> of the Church did hold there was <hi>Merit in good Works;</hi> but yet it is clear alſo by their Writings that the Word <hi>Merit</hi> did not then ſignifie as now it doth; then it ſignified only Rewarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs; and when any maintained that Works merited, the common Sence of them all, was no more than this, That their Works ſhould be rewarded by God, and this is all that they did affirm. But now the Word <hi>Merit</hi> ſignifies Deſert in Works ariſing from the Eqruality that is in them, to the Reward propounded and promiſed to them; and therefore now to aſſert that Works have <hi>Merit</hi> in them, is very unſafe and erroneous; which whilſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do, they do indeed ſtill retain the Expreſſions of the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> but the Sence is gone; that is, they ſtill hold faſt the <hi>Feather</hi> when the <hi>Bird</hi> is flown away. We ſhould therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware in our Diſcourſes of the doubtful Things of Religion, that we venture not upon thoſe Phraſes and Expreſſions that either border upon Error, or that may likely lead into Error. And truly the generality of Chriſtians have need of much ſpiritual Prudence and Sobriety, that while they deſire and are taken with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:105935:66"/> luſcious and ſweet Words and Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they do not withal ſuck in poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and deſtructive <hi>Errors.</hi> This ſhall ſuffice to be obſerved from the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Words foregoing, <hi>Prove all things,</hi> that is, all Doctrines that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to you, <hi>Hold faſt that which is good,</hi> but <hi>abſtain</hi> from that which hath but the <hi>appearance of evil in it;</hi> though the Doctrines themſelves that are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered be in ſome Sence ſound and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury, yet if they be delivered in a Sence and Expreſſion that may be wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſide to undue and erroneous Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations, abſtain as far as is poſſible from ſuch Expreſſions.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now conſider the Words under a more general Latitude as they relate unto <hi>Practice</hi> as well as to <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and ſo here the Apoſtle lays it down as an unerring Rule, That we muſt not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace any thing that hath but an <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and no more, whether that <hi>appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> be of <hi>good</hi> or of <hi>evil:</hi> We muſt not <hi>hold fast</hi> any thing that hath but the <hi>appearance</hi> of good only, and we muſt <hi>abſtain</hi> from every thing that hath but only the <hi>appearance of evil;</hi> and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:105935:66"/> therefore when licentious Perſons are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for the Vanity, Looſeneſs, Strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Immodeſty of their Garbs and Attire (that poſſibly more diſguiſeth than adorneth them) and other Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of a vain and frothy Mind, they think preſently to cover their Nakedneſs with ſuch <hi>Fig-leaves</hi> as theſe; What <hi>Evil</hi> is there in theſe things? Can you prove them ſinful? If you can, we will forbear the uſe of them; if you cannot, forbear you to reprove them. What if they could not be proved to be in themſelves ſinful; yet have they not the ſhew, the face, and the <hi>appearance of Evil?</hi> So judge all ſerious and ſober Chriſtians, and your ſelves alſo poſſibly may ſo judge ſometimes: Therefore diſpute not the Lawfulneſs or the Unlawfulneſs of theſe things in themſelves, if they have but the ſhew and the likeneſs of <hi>Evil</hi> in them, they are to be abſtained abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from. And truly conſidering that great Careleſneſs and want of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection that is even among Profeſſors themſelves, who if they can but keep themſelves from that which is intrinſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in it ſelf ſinful, make no ſcruple of venturing upon the borders and edges

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> We ought in no Caſe whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to do that which hath <hi>an appearance of Evil in it,</hi> if that appearance be grounded upon a probable Preſumption.</p>
                  <p>Now, to explain this; An Action then carries in it a probable Preſumption of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil, either,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> When ordinarily it proves an occaſion of Evil; ſuch Actions there be, that are in themſelves poſſibly lawful; but yet they prove <hi>occaſions</hi> of Sin to moſt that venture upon them, becauſe hereby many times they are brought within the Verge and Compaſs of a Temptation; which Temptation over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them. It was not ſimply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in it ſelf for <hi>Achan</hi> to look upon the <hi>Babyloniſh Garment,</hi> and the <hi>Wedge
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:105935:68"/> of Gold;</hi> but yet hereby the <hi>Devil</hi> got an Advantage upon him, and made that an occaſion to ſtir up his Covetouſneſs; and therefore, becauſe it was probably to be feared and preſumed, that this might be an <hi>occaſion</hi> of Sin to him, therefore he ought to have refrained even his very Eyes from looking upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> When an Action is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily done to an evil End, then it hath in it the <hi>appearance of Evil,</hi> grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a probable Preſumption. Thus to enter ſilently into another Man's Houſe in the dead of the night, carries in it a preſumption of <hi>Theft.</hi> And to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Temples</hi> of <hi>Idols</hi> at the time of <hi>Idolatrous Worſhip,</hi> carries in it a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> and ſo our Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, Familiarity, and Friendſhip with thoſe that are wicked, is a grounded preſumption that we are like them, and that we do as they do. And the reaſon of this is, becauſe, when we do thoſe Actions that commonly tend to a bad and ſinful end, it is an ill ſign that we intend the end it ſelf to which thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions lead. Now from every ſuch <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Evil,</hi> we ought in all Caſes
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:105935:69"/> to abſtain; and that for theſe Two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> Becauſe all ſuch <hi>Appearances of Evil</hi> always prove Scandals unto others. A Scandal is twofold; either the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of Sin, or the Scandal of Sorrow: Now this venturing upon the preſumed <hi>Appearance of Evil,</hi> proves a Scandal in both reſpects; it proves a Scandal of Sin to the weak, and it proves a Scandal of Sorrow to the ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It proves a Scandal of Sin to the weak. Then are we ſaid to give a a Scandal of Sin, when we do any thing that tends naturally to bring others into the commiſſion of Sin; but now the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>appearance</hi> of Sin in us, may lead o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the practice of Sin; when a weak Chriſtian ſees us run into thoſe things that are Occaſions of Sin, he alſo thinks he may lawfully venture as far as we do; and he venturing, becauſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he is weaker than we are, he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared and entrapped in thoſe Sins to the Occaſions of which we lead him by our Example.</p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:105935:69"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It proves alſo a <hi>Scandal</hi> of Sorrow to the ſtrong Chriſtians. They ſee ſuch probable ſigns and preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Sin by us, that they juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that certainly we are guilty of thoſe Sins, and thereby their Hearts alſo are ſadned and grieved. And that is the <hi>firſt Reaſon</hi> why we muſt forbear <hi>all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil,</hi> that is built upon ſtrong preſumptions that we have indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Evil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Reaſon is, becauſe all ſuch Occaſions of Sin, and ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of Sin have guilt in them alſo, as being againſt the ſame Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that that Sin violates and tends un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; for the ſame Commandment that forbids the Sin it ſelf, forbids all <hi>occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and all <hi>appearances</hi> of that Sin. That Commandment that forbids <hi>Theft,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids alſo whatever may induce, though but remotely, thereunto. And that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that forbids <hi>Adultery,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids alſo all remote occaſions thereof. Hence it is that <hi>Solomon</hi> gives the young man that ſcrupulous Caution againſt a ſtrange Woman, in <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Come not near the door of her Houſe.</hi> Why, to
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:105935:70"/> paſs by the door of her Houſe, is not in it ſelf unlawful; but yet when this may be juſtly feared to prove an occaſion of Sin, or when by going near a Houſe, it may be ſtrongly preſumed by others, that we are guilty of any Sin, then it muſt be carefully avoided and abſtained from. So again, <hi>When the Wine looks red in the Cup, Solomon</hi> bids us that we ſhould not then <hi>look</hi> upon it: Why, to look upon the Wine in the Cup, is not a thing that is unlawful; but becauſe this may be an occaſion of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Drunkenneſs, or the like; therefore we muſt abſtain from this very <hi>appearance</hi> and occaſion of <hi>Evil.</hi> So then, in the <hi>appearance of Evil,</hi> there is not only the evil of Scandal given to others, but there is alſo the evil of guilt in it ſelf. And therefore let us all exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves what at any time hath proved a ſnare to us, and what hath been an occaſion of ſinning. Have you not often ſaid it, and reſolved it, that you will venture but ſo far and no farther, and though you do approach near to Sin, yet you will keep your ſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your Duty, and have you not found it, that when you have ventured thus
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:105935:70"/> upon the <hi>occaſions of Sin,</hi> you have ſtopt no where ſhort of the commiſſion of thoſe Sins? This is to put your ſelves out of God's way, and to put your ſelves from under his protection; for God doth not uſually keep them from the <hi>commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Sin, who do not keep themſelves from the <hi>Occaſions and Appearances</hi> of Sin. And ſo much for the <hi>Firſt Poſition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if in caſe an Action <hi>appears evil</hi> to a Man's ſelf,, though this apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it be wholly groundleſs, then I ſhall lay down this <hi>Second Poſition:</hi> And that is,</p>
                  <p>Though an Action be in it ſelf indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, yet if it <hi>appear evil</hi> and ſinful to us, we ought not in any caſe, while that miſ-perſwaſion continues, to venture upon the doing of it; no, though by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, we might avoid the greateſt Evil: Yea, we are rather, if <hi>Providence</hi> bring us to that ſad choice, to loſe our very Lives, than to do any thing againſt the perſwaſions of our own Conſciences, though in it ſelf it be not evil or ſinful. The reaſon of this is clear; becauſe we are rather to chuſe the greateſt Affliction
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:105935:71"/> and Suffering, than to commit the leaſt Sin; but now to go contrary to the Dictates and Perſwaſions of our own Conſciences, this is Sin. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. <hi>Whatever is not of Faith, is Sin;</hi> that is, whatever a Man doth, if he be not fully perſwaded and convinced of the lawfulneſs thereof in his own Conſcience, that is a Sin to him that ventures upon it while he is unſatisfied, though the Thing in it ſelf may be lawful. And <hi>he that doubteth,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apostle,</hi> in the ſame Verſe, <hi>is damned if he eateth;</hi> that is, though there be no real difference betwixt one kind of Meat and another, but all are alike lawful; yet if a ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Conſcience puts a difference betwixt them, where there is none, and if it account it unlawful to eat of ſome ſorts of Meat, if after this, a Man ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to eat them, hereby he ſins, ſays the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and incurs damnation, by doing that againſt his Conſcience, that yet, were his Conſcience otherwiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, were lawful for him to do. And ſo, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.20. <hi>For Meat deſtroy not the Work of God; all things are pure, but it is evil for him who eateth with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi> Theſe and many other Places
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:105935:71"/> clearly prove that what is done againſt a Man's own Conſcience, that is ſinful, to that Man. Conſcience hath the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a Negative Vote in the Soul; nothing can lawfully be done by us but what hath the full conſent and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of our Conſciences, and though every thing we think is lawful, doth not thereupon preſently become lawful to us, yet what we think is unlawful, doth thereupon become unlawful for us to do, and we ought, whatever the caſe be, wholly to abſtain from the doing of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Action that we judge evil and unlawful to us, be our Duty, and ſo becomes neceſſary to us, then are we under a moſt ſad entanglement; we ſin if we do it, and we ſin alſo unleſs we do it. This is the unhappineſs of many, that through a miſ-informed Conſcience they verily believe they ought to abſtain from that which is indeed their Duty, and to do that wherein they ſin indeed if they do it: And ſo Chriſt ſpeaks of ſome that thought verily <hi>they did God good Service when they perſecuted and murdered his Saints,</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 16.2. If
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:105935:72"/> they did not what they thought was good ſervice to God, they ſinned on that hand; and yet if they killed the <hi>Saints,</hi> which they judged to be good ſervice, they ſinned on that hand alſo; ſo that they were entangled on both hands. So is it in our days alſo; we have ſeen and known many that thought it their duty to abſtain from Ordinances; yea, who thought it their duty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form no Duty at all to God: Now, if theſe Men abſtain from them, they ſin in doing that which is contrary to what God commands; if they uſe them, they ſin too, becauſe they do that which is contrary to what Conſcience commands. So that it is indeed the greateſt Plague and Puniſhment in the World for God to give Men up to the power of an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and miſ-guided Conſcience. Now, it appears that whatever a Man doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Conſcience, be the Action in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, or be the Action his Duty, and ſo is neceſſary; yet he ſins: Which is evident in two Things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe there is no man but thinks his Conſcience is rightly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:105935:72"/> no man thinks his Conſcience erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous: every one judgeth himſelf to be in the right, and to be rightly informed. Now, if he thus judgeth, and acts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily, he ſins, becauſe he intends to ſin; and therefore by croſſing an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Conſcience, though poſſibly he doth well in the Action, yet he ſins in Intention, ſince he doth that that he himſelf thinks doth croſs the Rule by which he ſhould walk.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Reaſon is this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by acting contrary to Conſcience, though miſ-informed, and erroneous, we do contemn the Authority and Will of God; and therefore it is Sin. We are all to guide our Conſciences by the Word that is God's written Will; and we are all to guide our Lives by our Conſciences. No man thinks his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to be erroneous; but thinks it to be according to the Will of God. Now, if we do not act accordingly, we ſin as much as if indeed it were informed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Will of God. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is God's Deputy and Vice-gerent in the Soul, and what Conſcience ſaith, we think it is God that commands, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:105935:73"/> it be or not; and to act contrary to it, is vertually and implicitely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey God; becauſe we think what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſpeaks, God ſpeaks; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very ſad to fall under the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglements of an erroneous Conſcience; for then we are under a ſad neceſſity of ſinning on both hands: if we act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to it, we ſin; and if we act not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it, we ſin. We ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, above all things, heartily beg and deſire of God, who is the Lord of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that he would rightly inform our Conſciences in thoſe things that are our Duties, that ſo by guiding our Lives by our Conſciences, we may guide them alſo according to his Will.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Three Poſitions now reſpect thoſe things that <hi>appear evil</hi> to our ſelves; but then there are other Things that have a good Appearance unto us, that yet may have an <hi>evil Appearance</hi> to others; they may ſcruple, and be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at what we do, though for our own parts, we our ſelves are ſufficiently ſatisfied in the Lawfulneſs of it. And indeed our Times (what through diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Cuſtoms and Intereſts) have brought
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:105935:73"/> Men's Conſciences alſo to ſuch different ſizes, that it is utterly impoſſible but ſome will condemn what others allow as lawful; yea, what others not only allow, but ſtiffly maintain to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and our Duty. How then ſhould we behave our ſelves in this Caſe? What Rules muſt we walk by, ſo as to keep Conſciences void of offence, not only to God, but as far as is poſſible towards Men alſo? In this, if any thing that belongs to Chriſtianity, there lies a great deal of difficulty to ſtate the Caſe aright, or aright to practiſe it; and the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is increaſed from theſe two Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, which I ſhall lay down as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Premiſes to the following Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> If we give no power to the ſcrupulous Judgments of weak and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſciences to oblige us to Duty, to abſtain from what appears evil to them, then we ſhall ſin evidently againſt the Law of <hi>Charity,</hi> and againſt many <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical</hi> Injunctions and Commands, that we ſhould have reſpect to their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and Cenſures; eſpecially in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> chap. 8, &amp; 10. almoſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:105935:74"/> throughout. Indeed there is ſcarce any one thing belonging to Chriſtianity that hath more Rules and Preſcripts oftner preſcribed by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to us, than this of abſtaining from offending the weak Conſciences of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If we make other Mens Conſciences the Rule of ours, and if we lay down this for a Maxim, That we ought to do nothing that appears evil to another.</p>
                  <p>This, <hi>Firſt,</hi> would be utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, ſince Men are of ſuch contrary Perſwaſions, that if the doing of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction appear evil to one, the omiſſion thereof appears as evil to another; ſo that unleſs we can at once both do it and not do it, ſome will unavoidably take offence at it, and be ſcandalized at us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This would abridge, yea, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroy all <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> in things indifferent; becauſe, if nothing ſhould be lawful that another ſcruples, then almoſt every thing would become ſinful, ſince almoſt every thing is ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled by ſome or other. In vain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:105935:74"/> is it to reckon it as our Priviledge, that we are freed from the <hi>Old Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law,</hi> and that heavy Yoke of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances that none were able to bear, if yet <hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> brings our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences under the moſt imperious Laws of mens Humours, Cenſures, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions; it were far eaſier to abſerve all the <hi>Levitical Law</hi> from one end of it to the other, than to be bound to thoſe <hi>worldly Rudiments,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls them in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>Touch not, taſte not, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not,</hi> wear not, ſpeak not, if ſuch a Perſon be offended at it, and count it unlawful.</p>
                  <p>Now, from the conſideration of theſe <hi>Two Particulars,</hi> I ſhall lay down this <hi>Fourth Poſition,</hi> concerning Abſtinence from the <hi>Appearance of Evil,</hi> in reſpect of others; and that is, if the <hi>Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Evil</hi> is to others, and not to our ſelves, then in ſome <hi>Caſes</hi> we are bound in Duty and Conſcience to <hi>abſtain</hi> from it, and in others not: Whatever hath the Shew or <hi>Appearance of Evil</hi> in it, it muſt either be commanded, and ſo it is neceſſary; or elſe it is left indifferent and arbitrary; and accordingly we may take theſe following Rules.</p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:105935:75"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> If ſo be thoſe things that <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear evil</hi> only to others, either are in themſelves, or at leaſt they appear to us to be commanded, and ſo neceſſary, we are bound not to regard; yea, we are bound to deſpiſe and ſcorn the <hi>Scruples</hi> of all the World; if they will be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at us for doing of that which is our duty, let them be offended; we may in this caſe uſe the ſame Plea that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.19. <hi>Whether it be right before the Lord to obey Men, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than God, judge ye.</hi> To perform a Duty, can be but a Scandal to men at the moſt, and thoſe alſo uſually of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaner ſort; but to omit a Duty for fear of Scandalizing men, is a Scandal and an Offence even unto God himſelf. It is moſt <hi>prepoſterous Charity</hi> to run upon Sin in our ſelves, only to prevent Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal in others. Though all the World cenſure Holineſs and Strictneſs of Life to be only a ſoure and rigid humour, and an affectation of Singularity; yet muſt we not, upon any pretence of gratifying their humour, or winning upon them, remit the leaſt part of that ſeverity that the Law of God, and our Conſciences require from us.</p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:105935:75"/>
                  <p>But, <hi>what if ſuppoſe, as too often it happens, that this ſtrictneſs and holy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity proves to be an occaſion of Sin unto others accidentally, what muſt we do in that caſe?</hi> What is it that makes ſo many hate Religion, and ſcoff at the Profeſſors thereof, but only their Lives are too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe and reſerved; Duties are too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and tedious; ſo that ſome laugh and mock, others ſtorm and rage, and all are frighted from the embracing of that Profeſſion that requires ſo much Rigour and Severity. Why, be it ſo, yet we muſt not abate any thing of our Duty, nor ſin our ſelves, to keep others from ſinning. Is it your duty to pray, or are you call'd to any other Duty? though you are aſſured that all that hear you, will ſcoff at you, yet you ought not therefore for fear of it, to forbear that Duty, or to leſſen your Fervency and Affection in it. Here indeed is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired much Spiritual Prudence and Diſcretion, to diſcern the Seaſons of our Duty for ſeveral Circumſtances; and among thoſe Offences that wicked Men may take, it may make that ceaſe from being a Duty that at other times is our Duty: And therefore the <hi>Wiſe Man</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:105935:76"/> in <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.4. bids us, <hi>not to anſwer a Fool according to his Folly;</hi> and yet in the next Verſe, he bids us, <hi>anſwer a Fool ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Folly;</hi> Two Commands quite contrary in two <hi>Verſes</hi> following one another: Now, this is to note to us, That according to ſeveral Circumſtances and ſeveral Opportunities, it may be our duty to abſtain at one time from that, that at another time it is our duty to do; it is our duty ſometimes not to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove a Fool,</hi> but to anſwer him <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Folly;</hi> and according to divers Circumſtances, at another time, it is our duty to <hi>reprove him,</hi> and not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer him <hi>according to his Folly.</hi> But yet notwithſtanding that which is our duty in its particular ſeaſon, and which we are convinced to be ſo, we ought to perform it, though all the World be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at it; yea, and if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that it ſhould prove an occaſion of Sin unto all the World, for, as we muſt not do evil out of hope that it may prove an occaſion of good; ſo neither muſt we forbear the doing of good, that evil may occaſionally enſue thereupon. Our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt was, as it was propheſied of him, to be <hi>a Stone of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:105935:76"/> and a Rock of offence;</hi> almoſt all were ſcandalized at him; ſome at his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as a deſpiſer of the <hi>Law of Moſes;</hi> others at his <hi>Converſation,</hi> as being a <hi>Glutton, a Wine-bibber, and a Friend of Publicans and Sinners;</hi> but yet for all theſe Out-cries, he alters no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing either in his Teaching, or his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; but whilſt they are clamouring againſt him, and ſpeaking evil of him, he ſtill goes about doing good: And truly thoſe that will be the Diſciples and Followers of Chriſt, though the way in which they are to worſhip and ſerve God, be generally decried, and every where ſpoken againſt, and carp'd at, as needleſs Peeviſhneſs: yet if it be a known Duty, they muſt not, they ought not to put themſelves out of the way of their obedience, to put others out of their groundleſs Offences. Only let me add a neceſſary Caution to this Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar alſo; for we cannot be too exact in ſtating this Caſe of <hi>giving offence</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and that is this.</p>
                  <p>If that <hi>appear</hi> a Duty to us that hath an <hi>Appearance of Evil</hi> in it to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the moſt ſober and ſerious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:105935:77"/> (let us ſuppoſe that) why now though this ſhould not preſently ſway our <hi>Conſciences,</hi> yet it ſhould engage us to make a ſtrict Search and Enquiry, whether it be our duty or not; if it is that which is contrary to the Opinion and Practice of holy and pious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, it ought to have this Authority with us, to put us to a ſtand, and to make us to examine whether that which we account a Duty, be indeed a Duty or not: As for inſtance, ſome among us at this day are perſwaded that they ought to worſhip God one way, and ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and what appears a Duty to one, hath the appearance of Evil in it to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? why now follow neither of theſe; becauſe it is their Judgment and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; but yet if thy perſwaſion be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the perſwaſion of the moſt pious and moſt ſober Chriſtians, this ought ſo far to prevail, as to make men ſuſpect leſt they are miſtaken, and to put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a diligent Enquiry, and an impartial Search into their Grounds and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but after all, ſtill follow that which you are convinced in your own Conſcience is your Duty, how evil ſoever it may appear to others either one way
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:105935:77"/> or other. And that's the firſt Particular: If thoſe things appear evil to others that are our duty, or neceſſary, or that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo to us, we ought not to regard the Cenſures and Opinions of others concerning it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If ſo be thoſe things that are in themſelves <hi>indifferent,</hi> and appear to us ſo to be, have yet an <hi>evil appearance</hi> unto others, if they be offended and ſcandalized at them, then the Rule of Chriſtian Charity obligeth us to abſtain from them. I call thoſe Things <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi> that are neither in themſelves for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, nor yet commanded, but only permitted and left to the arbitrary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of every private Chriſtian's Prudence and Diſcretion. As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, under the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> ſome kinds of Meat were unlawful; as in <hi>Lev.</hi> 11. And ſome kinds of <hi>Garments</hi> were unlawful to be worn; as in <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.19. But now, under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſince the aboliſhing of thoſe <hi>Carnal Ordinances,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.4. both all ſorts of <hi>Meat</hi> become lawful, whilſt we uſe them within the Bounds of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and Moderation; and all ſorts
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:105935:78"/> of <hi>Garments</hi> may be lawfully worn, while we uſe them within the Bounds of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and Decency: Theſe Things are left free for us to uſe them, or not to uſe them, without Sin, according to our own conveniency and diſcretion. Theſe Things I call indifferent Things. And yet ſuch is the ſtrictneſs of <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> that theſe indifferent, lawful Things are not to be uſed at random nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is a certain Truth, though it may ſeem a Paradox, that we never ſin in any thing more than in doing that which is in it ſelf lawful; in theſe things we uſually offend, either by uſing them immoderately, or with a neglect, yea, with a contempt of thoſe Conſciences that are weak. The Uſe of our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> is not uncontroulable; but God hath ſubjected it to the <hi>Conſciences</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; ſo that it is utterly unlawful for us to do that which is in it ſelf lawful, if it give offence unto others. How this ought to be limited I ſhall ſhew you by and by; in the mean time, ſee it clearly proved out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. from <hi>v.</hi> 25. to the end. Where the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides this <hi>Queſtion, Whether it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to eat Meat that was offered to Idols.</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:105935:78"/> For the underſtanding of this, you muſt know, it was a cuſtom among the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> to offer Cattel in Sacrifice to their <hi>Idol-Gods;</hi> part whereof they did eat in their <hi>Religious Feasts</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Remainder in the common Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket. Now, the Queſtion was not, Whether it was unlawful to join with the <hi>Heathens</hi> in eating of their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> before their <hi>Idols;</hi> for this were to join with them in their <hi>Idolatrous Worſhip?</hi> But there were ſome more <hi>ſcrupulous Chriſtians</hi> among them, that judged it unlawful to <hi>eat</hi> of thoſe <hi>Sacrifices</hi> when ſold in the <hi>Shambles,</hi> or common Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket; the Apoſtle now there determines this Matter to be altogether indifferent, in <hi>ver.</hi> 25. <hi>Whatſoever is ſold in the Shambles,</hi> whether offered to <hi>Idols,</hi> or not, <hi>that eat;</hi> but yet, if any <hi>weak Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> even ſo ſcruple to eat that which is offered to <hi>Idols</hi> after it is ſold in the <hi>Shambles,</hi> and if he be offended at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for eating of it, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> then gives this Rule, That the ſtrong ought not to eat for the ſake of the weak, though the thing be indifferent, and might be done; yet the ſtrong ought not to eat for the ſake of the weak, in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:105935:79"/> 
                     <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>If any ſay, This was offered in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Idols,</hi> though ſold in the Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, yet <hi>eat not for his ſake that ſhewed you it.</hi> Now, what the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here ſpeaks of <hi>Meat</hi> offered in <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,</hi> holds true proportionably in <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,</hi> in <hi>Recreations,</hi> and the like indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent lawful Things; all which become Sin to you, if they become <hi>Offences</hi> and <hi>Scandals</hi> unto others. Now, the Reaſon of this, is evident; becauſe when Men raſhly do what they think is lawful, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding the <hi>Scruples</hi> of others, hereby they do as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.13. <hi>put a ſtumbling-Block, and an ocaſion of falling in their Brothers way,</hi> that is, they bring him into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of a Sin, and this is againſt the Law of <hi>Charity.</hi> For ſays the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>If thy Brother be grieved at thy Meat, thou walkeſt not charitably.</hi> Now, in doing that which <hi>appears evil</hi> to others, though it be lawful in it ſelf, yet it may be an occaſion of Sin to them two Ways.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It may alienate their Hearts from the Ways of God.</hi> When notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Profeſſion thou makeſt of Holineſs, and of Strictneſs of Life
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:105935:79"/>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It brings Sin alſo; becauſe it may encourage them to do the ſame things that you do alſo.</hi> Now that may be Sin to them that is to you lawful; becauſe, as I told you, whatever is done contrary to the Dictates and perſwaſions of a Man's own Conſcience, that is Sin to him: But now many weak Chriſtians may be induced to act contrary to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, only acting according to the examples of ſtronger Chriſtians, that are better informed, &amp; that have more Light to direct them, and ſo by their unlimited doing what they think is lawful, they bring a great deal of guilt upon the Conſciences of others that are weak, and that ſcruple the things they ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do; and yet becauſe they ſee others do them, will themſelves venture to do them alſo, though they ſcruple it. It
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:105935:80"/> is not enough therefore that you your ſelves are ſatisfied in your own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that what you do is lawful; but you muſt weigh and conſider how it will ſuit with the Conſciences of other men alſo, elſe what you think is lawful, may be a Sin both unto you and unto them; to them, becauſe they are brought to ſin by your example; and to you, becauſe you brought them to ſin by doing that which was to you lawful.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> We are not obliged to abſtain from things indifferent that may have in them an <hi>Appearance of Evil</hi> to others, unleſs we have ſome grounds to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that they take offence, and are ſcandalized at them. We are not bound to ask every one that we meet with, whether they ſcruple ſuch and ſuch a thing that we muſt do; this were end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ridiculous. We are not obliged to abſtain, if there be only a remote poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of Scandal, unleſs there be alſo ſome great probability of it; nor are we bound to divine whether or no it be not poſſible that ſuch an Action of ours may be offenſive to ſome or other; but if there be no preſent probability to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture that ſuch a thing may be offenſive, we may then lawfully do whatever is lawful unto us. And therefore,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> If by comparing the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of an Action together, we cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably gueſs any ſhould be offended at it, it is their weakneſs, and not our Sin, if they be offended at it. Indeed, whenever we converſe with others, it becomes our Chriſtian Prudence and Charity to weigh ſuch Circumſtances exactly, to conſider
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:105935:81"/> the Action that we do, though lawful yet whether or no it be common or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual; to conſider the Perſons with whom we are, whether weak o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſtrong, whether ſcrupulous or reſolved Chriſtians; for that which may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſome of theſe Circumſtances, may be unlawful in others of them: An Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be lawful if it be common though it be done before a <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>ſcrupulous Christian,</hi> and it may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful though uncommon, if it be done before a <hi>ſtrong</hi> and a <hi>reſolved Christian;</hi> but if it be unuſual, and if it be done before a <hi>ſcrupulous</hi> and a <hi>weak Christian</hi> it may ſeem to have in it a great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of giving of <hi>Offence</hi> and being a <hi>Scandal</hi> to them; and therefore we muſt forbear ſuch uncommon, unuſual actions before weak Chriſtians, in which there may be any probable gueſs that they will take offence, and be ſcandalized at them; but if upon examining theſe and the like Circumſtances, we can find no ſuch probability of giving of Offence, we may then make uſe of our <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> in them.</p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:105935:81"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If after we have weighed theſe Circumſtances, and can find no probability of <hi>Scandal</hi> in them, if others with whom we are, or who are liable to take exception, if they do not diſcover their Exceptions, we are not bound to abſtain from any thing that is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently lawful. We have a hint of this from the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.28. <hi>If any one ſay to you, this was offered to Idols, eat not;</hi> if he ſay to you. But if they take <hi>offence,</hi> and will not make it known, the <hi>offence,</hi> as it reſts in their own boſom, ſo ſhall it lie on their own heads, and we ſhall it be guiltleſs; and that's the firſt Limitation. We are not bound to <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain</hi> from things lawful in themſelves, though they carry in them an <hi>appearance of Evil</hi> towards others, if there be no probable grounds to conjecture that they will be offended at them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We muſt conſider whether or not the Action that we do, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother takes <hi>offence</hi> at, be as <hi>indifferent</hi> to us, as it is <hi>indifferent</hi> in, reſpect of God, that is, whether it be of great conveniency, or of great importance and concernment to us, if it be not of ſuch

It is not enough to oblige our Conſciences, that they tell us they imagine ſuch a thing to be evil, unleſs they ſhew ſome Grounds for their Imagination; nor is it here required, that the Grounds they produce ſhould be demonſtrative; but it is enough if they be probable Grounds, though they amount not to prove the things that <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear evil</hi> to them, to be in themſelves evil; yet if they prove theſe things car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in them a probable preſumption of evil, this is ſufficient to oblige us to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from them. Hereupon it was that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> forbid the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to <hi>eat Meat offered unto Idols;</hi> if any took offence at that Meat, others were not to eat thereof in their preſence and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that becauſe their offence had ſome probable ſhew of Reaſon to judge
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:105935:83"/> that they thought they had too much communion with <hi>Idols,</hi> becauſe they did <hi>eat</hi> of thoſe things that were <hi>ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> to them: And upon this ground the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> himſelf reſolves, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi> That <hi>if Meat made his Brother to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, he would eat no Fleſh while the World ſtood;</hi> that is (as I take it) <hi>no Fleſh offered to Idols;</hi> for that is the Subject of which he had been treating all along that <hi>Chapter.</hi> Though it was lawful in it ſelf conſidered, yet becauſe the weak had probable Grounds and Reaſons to ſhew why <hi>Fleſh offered to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols,</hi> might not be eaten, therefore he would abſtain from it whilſt the World ſtood. And ſo in like manner, if any except againſt what we do, and bring this Reaſon for it, That it is too like the Cuſtom of wicked Men, that none do thus and thus but the generality of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But now, if there be no ſuch probable Reaſons produced as carry in them a Shew and Appearance,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:105935:84"/> that probably that is evil which we do, then we are not bound to abſtain merely becauſe ſuch a Man ſaith or thinks ſuch an Action is evil: As for inſtance; if any think, as of late many have taken exception againſt Preaching in a <hi>Pulpit,</hi> and by an <hi>Hour-Glaſs,</hi> as things unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, truly unleſs they produce ſome Grounds to prove theſe Things to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, their Cavils are not to be heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to, nor regarded; and ſo in any other Things that are <hi>Indifferent</hi> to be uſed.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt Place, take this Limitation alſo; We are not bound to <hi>abſtain</hi> from thoſe things that <hi>appear evil</hi> to others, though they are in themſelves lawful, unleſs in thoſe places, and at thoſe times where there is no danger of giving <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;</hi> at other times, and in other places we may lawfully do what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. When there are any preſent that are weak and ſcrupulous, and apt to be ſcandalized at us, then we muſt have reſpect unto their weak Conſciences; but at other times we are left to the free and full uſe of our Chriſtian Liberty.</p>

                  <p>HAving in my former Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject treated of Abſtinence from thoſe Things that have in them the <hi>Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Evil,</hi> I ſhall now from the Words read to you, ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alſo of thoſe things that are <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently evil;</hi> that, as you have already in part ſeen what Chriſtian Prudence and Circumſpection is required that your Converſations be not <hi>offenſive;</hi> ſo here you may alſo ſee what Fervency of

                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Verſe</hi> immediately before the <hi>Text,</hi> the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> prays that God would <hi>cleanſe him from his ſecret Faults;</hi> that is, from Sins of Ignorance, whereof he knew himſelf to be guilty in the general, though in particular he knew not what they were; now in this <hi>Verſe,</hi> he prays, that God would keep him from Sins of <hi>Preſumption.</hi> The Connexion of theſe two Requeſts is ſomewhat remarkable, and may afford us this pertinent and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Obſervation.</p>

                     <hi>That Sin is of a growing and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From Weakneſs to Wilfulneſs; from Ignorance to Preſumption, is its ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſe and progreſs. The <hi>Cloud</hi> that <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Man ſaw, was at firſt no bigger than a hand's breadth, and it threatned no ſuch thing as a general Tempeſt; but yet at laſt it overſpread the face of the whole Heavens: Why, ſo truly a Sin that at firſt ariſeth in the Soul, but as a ſmall Miſt, and is ſcarce diſcernable; yet
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:105935:86"/> if it be not ſcattered by the breath of Prayer, it will at length overſpread the whole Life, and become moſt tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and raging; and therefore <hi>David,</hi> as one experienced in the deceitfulneſs of Sin, doth thus digeſt and methodize his Prayer; Firſt, againſt ſecret and leſſer Sins; and then againſt the more groſs and notorious; as knowing the one proceeds and iſſues from the other: <hi>Lord, cleanſe me from my ſecret faults;</hi> and this will be a moſt effectual means to preſerve and keep thy Servant from <hi>Preſumptuous Sins:</hi> and this <hi>Obſervation</hi> may be gathered from the connexion of the two Requeſts: But I ſhall not inſiſt on that.</p>
                  <p>The Words are a moſt ſincere and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Prayer; and in them are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The Perſon that makes it; and that is not a vile, notorious Sinner, one that uſed to be overcome by preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sins; but <hi>David,</hi> a Man after God's own heart, eminent for Holineſs and Piety; <hi>Keep back thy Servant,</hi> ſays he, <hi>from preſumptuous Sins.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Requeſt and Petition it ſelf; and that is, that God would keep him, not from Sins of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Frailty, and daily Infirmity, ſuch as no Man's Holineſs can exempt him from; but from Sins of Preſumption; from daring and ranting Sins, ſuch as one would think, that no Man that hath the leaſt Holineſs in him, could ever commit, <hi>Keep back thy Servant from preſumptuous Sins.</hi> In this <hi>Petition</hi> two Things are evidently implied.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That ſtrong propenſion that there is in the beſt to the worſt Sins.</hi> Were it not ſo, what need <hi>David</hi> pray for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining-Grace? <hi>Keep back thy Servant.</hi> Lord, my Corruptions hurry me with all violence into the greateſt Sins; they perſwade, they force, they drag, they draw, they thruſt forward, and now, now I am going and yielding; but, Lord, with-hold me, put a curb and check up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe violent and head ſtrong Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of mine; keep back, <hi>keep me back from preſumptuous Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It implies that utter impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency that the beſt lie under to preſerve
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:105935:87"/> themſelves from the fouleſt ſins, without the ſpecial aid and aſſiſtance of divine Grace.</hi> My Heart it is not in my own hands; my Ways are not at my own diſpoſe; I cannot ſtand longer than thou upholdeſt me; I cannot walk longer than thou leadeſt me; if thou withdraweſt thine everlaſting Arms from under me, I ſhall ſtumble, and fall, and tumble headlong into fearful Precipices, into vile Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, into Hell and Perdition it ſelf; and therefore, <hi>Lord,</hi> do thou keep me; do thou by thy Omnipotency ſupply my Impotency; by thy Power keep me from what mine own Weakneſs will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly betray me unto; <hi>Keep back thy Servant from preſumptuous Sins.</hi> Theſe two Things are implied and couched in the Petition it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In the Text we have the Reaſon alſo why <hi>David</hi> prays ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt preſumptuous Sins: Which Reaſon carries in it the Form of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Petition by it ſelf; <hi>Keep back thy Servant from preſumptuous Sins; let them not have dominion over me;</hi> but yet it may be well underſtood as a Reaſon of the foregoing Requeſt; therefore, <hi>Lord,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:105935:88"/> keep me from preſumptuous Sins;</hi> leſt by falling into the commiſſion of them, I fall alſo under the power of them; leſt by prevailing upon me, they get dominion and ſovereignty over me. And in this Reaſon alſo we have a hint of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching nature of Sin ſtill, from the allowance of little and ſecret Sins, it proceeds to the commiſſion of groſs and preſumptuous Sins; and from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of theſe, it proceeds to dominion over him; and therefore if we would not be Slaves to our Luſts, and Vaſſals to the Devil, we had need all of us to pray with <hi>David,</hi> Lord, <hi>keep us from ſecret Sins,</hi> leſt they break out into open and preſumptuous Sins; and, Lord, <hi>keep us from preſumptuous Sins,</hi> leſt they get dominion over us.</p>
                  <p>Now, from the Words thus divided and opened, ſeveral uſeful <hi>Obſervations</hi> may be raiſed.</p>
                  <p>As, <hi>Firſt,</hi> From the <hi>Petition</hi> it ſelf, we may obſerve theſe Two Doctrinal Points.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>in the very beſt Chriſtians there is great proneneſs and inclination to the very worſt Sins. David</hi> himſelf prays for reſtraining Grace to keep him from <hi>preſumptuous Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Obſerve, <hi>It is not our own <label type="milestone">

                  <p>And then from the <hi>Perſon</hi> who makes this Prayer and Requeſt unto God, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That, <hi>Becauſe the ſtrongeſt <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>3</label> Chriſtians are too weak of themſelves to reſiſt the greateſt Sins, therefore they ought continually to implore the aid and aſſiſtance of Divine Grace.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:105935:89"/> he prays the Lord to keep him; <hi>Keep thou thy Servant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then, Laſtly, from the Reaſon, <hi>Keep me from preſumptuous Sins, leſt they get dominion over me;</hi> or, <hi>let them not get dominion over me:</hi> Obſerve,</p>

                  <p>In the Proſecution of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhew you, when it is that a Man is guilty of preſumptuous Sins, and wherein the Nature of ſuch Sins conſiſts.</p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:105935:89"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, Then a Sin is preſumptuous, when it is committed againſt the powerful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of a Man's own Conſcience, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the clear Convictions of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> When Conſcience is awakened in Conviction, and rings aloud in Men's Ears, the ways thou liveſt in are groſly ſinful, the end of them is <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> thou wadeſt through the deareſt Blood of thine own Soul if thou goeſt on; ſeeſt thou not how Guilt diſmally ſtares thee in the Face? Seeſt thou not how the Mouth of <hi>Hell</hi> belches out Fire, and Flames, and Brimſtone againſt thee? ſtop therefore, I here, as God's Officer, arreſt thee. If now, when <hi>Conſcience</hi> thus calls, and cries, and threatens, Men will yet venture on, this is moſt bold and daring Preſumption: To diſobey the Arreſt but of the <hi>King's Officer,</hi> is a moſt preſumptuous Crime; how much more therefore to diſobey the Arreſt of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> which is the chief and <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Officer</hi> of God, and who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in the name, yea, in the ſtead of God, as it were, in the Soul; and yet truly, who among us is not in ſome kind or other guilty of this Preſumption? Why, Sirs, if God ſhould now come down
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:105935:90"/> in <hi>terrible Majeſty</hi> in the midſt of us, and if he ſhould ask every man's <hi>Conſcience</hi> here, one by one, Conſcience, wert thou ever reſiſted? wert thou ever oppoſed in executing thine Office to this and to that Soul? Why, where ſits the Perſon whoſe <hi>Conſcience</hi> muſt not anſwer, <hi>Yes, Lord, I accuſe him, I teſtifie to his very face, I have often warned and admoniſhed him, O do not venture upon this or that Action; there's Sin, there's Guilt lies under it; there's Wrath and Vengeance that will follow it; Oh pity, oh ſpare thine own Soul; this Sin will everlastingly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine thee if thou committest it:</hi> And what didſt thou commit it notwithſtanding all this? <hi>Yes, Lord, while I was laying before him all the arguments that the thoughts of Heaven and Hell, of thy Glory and his own Happineſs, could adminiſter, yet ſo preſumptuous was he, as to fall upon me thine Officer; and theſe Stabs, theſe Gaſhes and Wounds I received while I was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing him, and warning him in thy Name.</hi> O Sirs, a thouſand times better were it for us that we never had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, better that our <hi>Conſciences</hi> were utterly ſeared, and become inſenſible; better that they were ſtruck for ever
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:105935:90"/> dumb, and ſhould never open their Mouths more to reprove or to rebuke us; better that we never had had the leaſt glimmering of Light to diſtinguiſh betwixt our Duty, and what is Sin, than thus deſperately to out-face and ſtifle our convictions, and to offer violence to our <hi>Conſciences,</hi> and preſumptuouſly to ruſh into the commiſſion of Sin in deſpight of all theſe; better men had no Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences at all, or that they were given up to a ſeared and a reprobate Senſe; than to ſin thus in deſpight of their <hi>Conſciences.</hi> What ſays our Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47. <hi>That Servant that knew his Lord's Will, and did it not, he ſhall be beaten with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtripes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two Things wherein it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that all Sins againſt Conſcience,<note place="margin">Two Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations of ſinning againſt Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> and againſt Convictions, are preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Sins.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. It is a Contempt of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of God.</note> 
                     <hi>Becauſe in all ſuch Sins there is a moſt horrid Contempt of the Authority &amp; Sovereignty of the great God:</hi> And what higher Preſumption can there be, than for vile Worms to ſet at nought the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> of that God at whoſe Frown Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:105935:91"/> and Hell, and Earth tremble. The <hi>Voice of Conſcience</hi> rightly informed by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> it is the <hi>Voice of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> it is God ſpeaking in a man's Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and whiſpering to a man's very Heart. As <hi>Moſes</hi> was the <hi>Interpreter</hi> betwixt God and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> ſo <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> is the <hi>Interpreter</hi> betwixt God and us. Why now, would it not have been, think you, a moſt deſperate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and a moſt daring Affront a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Majeſty and Sovereignty of God, if while he was with his own voice pronouncing the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> with Thundering, and Lightening, and Earth-quake from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> at the ſame time the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to have been notoriouſly breaking and ſinning againſt every one of thoſe <hi>Commandments,</hi> as he ſpake them. Truly, though now God delivers his Will and Commands to us, not immediately by his own mouth, as then he did, but by <hi>Conſcience</hi> his <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,</hi> yet while we know that <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> ſpeaks to us in the Name of God, it is as much fearful Preſumption for us to ſlight the voice of Conſcience, as if we ſhould ſlight the voice of God himſelf ſpeaking from heaven immediately to us. And that's the <hi>first</hi> Thing.</p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:105935:91"/>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Is is an evident argument that we ſtand in no awe of Hell and Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                     <hi>By ſinning againſt our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and againſt our Convictions, we make it very evident that we ſtand in no awe or dread of any ſuch thing as Hell and eternal Damnation is, and is not that Boldneſs? Is not that Preſumption?</hi> You ſcorn poſſibly to be ſuch puling, whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering Sinners as to be affrighted with ſuch Bug-bears as everlaſting Torments, and everlaſting Wrath and Vengeance is; you know the <hi>Wages of Sin is Death,</hi> and that the Ways you take, lead down to the Chambers of Deſtruction; and yet though <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Devil</hi> ſtand in the way you will through: Are not theſe, think you, bold and preſumptuous Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that will go on in Sin, though <hi>Hell-Fire</hi> flaſhes in their Faces, who, though God ſhould cleave the Ground upon which they walk, and through that Chink ſhould give them a view of <hi>Hell;</hi> though they ſhould ſee the Damned tumbling up and down in thoſe Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and hear their Yellings and Shriekings, and Roarings; yea, though God ſhould point them out a place in <hi>Hell,</hi> and tell them, Look, Sinner, yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is a Place kept void, and heated from the beginning of the World for thee;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:105935:92"/> yet are there ſome ſuch bold and daring Wretches, that they would out-brave all this, and they would ſin in deſpight ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Hell;</hi> yea, and which is a moſt ſad and dreadful conſideration, ſome there are whoſe <hi>Conſciences</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready brim-full of extreme horrour and anguiſh, and yet they will venture upon thoſe Sins that have cauſed that horrour, and are not ſuch preſumptuous Sinners, they give their <hi>Conſciences</hi> wound upon wound, and though ſometimes they roar bitterly, yet they will ſin outragiouſly, even then when they roar and ſmart for Sin: So that this is a clear evidence of a <hi>preſumptuous Sin,</hi> when a Sin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt a Man's own Conſcience, againſt Knowledge, &amp; againſt Conviction; this makes a Sin to be a preſumptuous Sin, when Conſcience cries out Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Murder, Soul-Murder; when it beſeeches with Tears of Blood that they draw from it, to deſiſt from their Sins, and yet is not heard nor regarded; this is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinning,</hi> ſinning with a high hand, and with a brazen Forehead.</p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:105935:92"/>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">To ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on long deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to ſin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</note> 
                     <hi>Then a Man ſins preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, when he ſins upon long deliberation and forecast, plotting and contriving with himſelf how he may accompliſh his Sin.</hi> Some Sins are committed merely through a ſudden Surprize; a Temptation comes upon the Soul unawares and finds it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided to make any reſiſtance, and ſo it prevails? So it was with the Apoſtle St. <hi>Peter,</hi> his Apoſtacy and Perjury was indeed very dreadful; yet he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by a ſudden Surprize; he had no foregoing Thoughts and Purpoſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his Maſter; yea, his Reſolution was to own and confeſs him to the very Death; and therefore though his Sins were foul Sins, yet they cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>preſumptuous Sins,</hi> but rather Sins of weakneſs and infirmity. And ſo there are divers Chriſtians that are overtaken with Faults againſt their Reſolutions and Prayers, yea, and contrary to their own Expectations; now the Sins of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are not <hi>preſumptuous Sins;</hi> but then a Sin becomes preſumptuous, when it is committed after long deliberation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation and Fore-caſt. There is a twofold Deliberation that makes a Sin preſumptuous.</p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:105935:93"/>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>When a Man ſins after he hath deliberated with himſelf, whether he ſhall ſin or not.</hi> When upon debating the Caſe at length after much pondering and conſideration, he conſents to Sin; And thus though St. <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Maſter upon a Surprizal, yet <hi>Judas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd him upon deliberation. Now this is moſt deſperate high Preſumption to ſin when a man ponders and conſiders with himſelf, and weighs the Reaſons on both ſides, whether he ſhall ſin or not; and yet truly of ſuch preſumptuous Sins as theſe are, we may all of us be found guilty. Why, ask but your ſelves, Did you never commit a Sin after you had weighed in your deliberate Thoughts all Circumſtances, putting in the beneficial Conſequences, the Pleaſure, Profit and Credit of Sin in the one Balance, and the dangerous and deſtructive Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, that Wrath and Hell that is due to Sin, in the other Balance? who of us all can acquit himſelf from being guilty of ſinning after ſuch Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as theſe are have been made, after the due weighing both of Sin and our Duty; and yet have we not choſen the Sin before our Duty? Truly to ſin after
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:105935:93"/> ſuch deliberate Compariſons as theſe are, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s a provoking and a preſumptuous Sin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>When Men do deliberate and contrive how they may ſin to the greateſt advantage, how they may make the moſt of their Iniquities; when they plot and contrive with themſelves how they may ſqueeze and draw out the very utmoſt of all that Pleaſure and Sweet that they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine Sin carries with it; this makes that Sin a preſumptuous Sin.</hi> Thus thoſe <hi>Drunkards</hi> contrived to prolong their Sin, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 56. <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>Come,</hi> ſay they, <hi>we will fetch Wine, and fill our ſelves with ſtrong Drink, and to morrow ſhall be as this day, and much more abundant.</hi> Here they forecaſted to make as great advantage as they could of their Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and to get as much pleaſure out of it as they could.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:105935:98"/> empty Nothings, have weighed down the Scales with you againſt God. The <hi>Devil</hi>'s firſt and greateſt ſin was Pride, and Contempt of God, and how much is he pleaſed and humoured to ſee the ſame Contempt of God rivetted in the Hearts of Men, and to ſee him ſo much ſlighted in the World, that he can ſcarce bid low enough when he <hi>Tempts,</hi> but whatever he offers is greedily ſnatch'd at, and preferred before God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, though it be but a very <hi>Toy</hi> and <hi>Trifle.</hi> This certainly muſt needs be a very heinous Contempt of the great Majeſty of Heaven, and muſt needs ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue moſt deſperate boldneſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinning.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>When Men ſin upon ſmall or no temptations, they declare plainly a wretched neglect of their precious Souls, and therefore they ſin preſumptuouſly.</hi> I have Read of a <hi>Soldier</hi> who being with Two others for ſome Crime Condemned, drew <hi>Lots</hi> for his Life, and having drawn one <hi>Lot</hi> that ſaved and pardon'd him, ſeeing one of his Companions come ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and quaking to draw, told him, that for Two Shillings, or thereabouts,

How many are there that would not ſuffer no not ſo much as a <hi>Hair</hi> of their Head to be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>twitched off to gain that for which they will not ſtick to <hi>Lye</hi> and <hi>Swear,</hi> Sins that Murder their Souls? They are ſo Fooliſh, that the Lord complains in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.3. <hi>They ſell themſelves for Nought;</hi> either they ſtay not till the <hi>Devil</hi> comes to cheapen them, but Sin before-hand, or elſe they readily take any Price that he offers for them, any Vile Trifle is looked upon as a great Purchaſe, if they can procure it at ſo low a Price as <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> is; why, what is it that makes the <hi>Swearer</hi> open his Throat as wide as <hi>Hell</hi> againſt Heaven and God himſelf, but only that he fanſies that a big, full-Mouth'd <hi>Oath</hi> makes his <hi>Speech</hi> more graceful and ſtately? And what is it that makes the <hi>Company-keeper</hi> run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Exceſs with Riot, and to drown himſelf in all Senſuality, but only that he may comply with his Debauched Companions, and not diſguſt them by any ſingularity and reſervedneſs? And

Is it poſſible that Men that have Noble and Immortal Souls in them, ſhould ever ſo far debaſe them, as to bring them into competition with, nay to make them to be the Price of ſuch Vile Nothings as theſe are? And yet tell theſe Men that they hereby rouze up God's Wrath againſt them that burns to the loweſt Hell; tell them that they deſtroy their precious Souls; tell them that they get nothing by ſuch ſins as theſe are, unleſs they reckon Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Gain: Why, yet let God frown, and Hell triumph, and their Souls pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, they will on, and will not raiſe the Rate of ſinning, nor put the <hi>Devil</hi> to more charges, and ſo they are Damned for nothing. Is not this moſt deſperate boldneſs and preſumption? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not lay the blame of your ſins upon the violence of <hi>Temptation,</hi> or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the reſtleſs importunities of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> when God ſhall at the laſt Day call, Sinner ſtand forth, what's the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon you committed ſuch and ſuch Sins

No, no it will then be made apparent, that the <hi>Devil</hi> was falſly charged with multitudes of Sins that he never knew of till they were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And therefore when Men ſin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>ſlight Temptations,</hi> it is not from the power of <hi>Temptations,</hi> it is not from the importunity of the <hi>Devil</hi> that they ſin, but only from a preſumptuous reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that they will ſin whatever it coſt them, and that's the firſt Trial.</p>

What ſays the <hi>Wiſe Man,</hi> Proverbs 26.27. <hi>Can a Man take Fire into his Boſom, and his Cloths not be burnt?</hi> Can a Man run himſelf upon ſuch occaſions of ſin, and not run alſo into the commiſſion of ſin? As the Motion of a Stone, when it falls down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:105935:101"/> is ſtill the ſwifter the nearer it comes to its Center; ſo when you are running your ſelves into the occaſions of ſin, the more willingly you go to ſin, the nearer you come to it, there's no ſtop nor ſtay: When you put your ſelves upon theſe <hi>Occaſions</hi> and <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> you put your ſelves out of the protection of God's Grace, and you ſtand wholly at the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Courteſie; and if you are overcome, blame no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but your own venturouſneſs and preſumption.

                     <hi>The Examples of others may here be a convincing Argument.</hi> If I ſhould ſummon in the moſt excellent of God's Saints, a Man might wonder that <hi>Drunkenneſs, Inceſt, Murder,</hi> and <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration of Chriſt,</hi> that ſuch Brats of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> ſhould ever be found in company with ſuch an <hi>Angelical</hi> Troop as they are; and yet <hi>Noah</hi> is <hi>Drunk, Lot</hi> is <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous, David Murders,</hi> and <hi>Peter Abjures;</hi> theſe glorious Stars have had their twinklings; and if the Leaders and Champions are thus foiled, what may we think then hath in all Ages befallen the Croud of Vulgar Chriſtians: We may with truth and boldneſs ſay, Never was there a ſin committed in the World,

                     <hi>It appears that there is a ſtrong proneneſs in the beſt to the worſt Sins, from thoſe frequent and preſſing Exhortations that are given us in</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>to Watchfulneſs againſt them, and to the Mortification of them.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were theſe Curbs neceſſary, but that God ſees our Luſts are head-ſtrong, and ready to fly out and hurry us into all Exceſſes? Nay theſe Exhortations are not ſo particularly, nor with ſo great <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> given to the <hi>Wicked</hi> as they are to the <hi>Children of God:</hi> Of the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:105935:116"/> Wicked God ſaith, <hi>He that will be Wicked, let him be Wicked ſtill,</hi> that's all the Care God takes of them, as we uſe to ſay of them that we deſpair to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, Nay let them take their own courſes: But he eſpecially warns and exhorts the Godly to beware of thoſe Sins that one would think a Godly Man were ſcarce liable to commit. See how Chriſt Cautions his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> Luke 21.34. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves,</hi> ſays he, <hi>leaſt at any time your Hearts be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with Surfeiting and Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Cares of this Life:</hi> Why, would not any Man wonder, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſhould ſo ſolicitouſly warn them againſt <hi>Surfeiting</hi> and <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> which are the Sins uſually of a Plentiful Eſtate, but what, warn them againſt theſe Sins whoſe Poverty was ſuch, and was to be ſuch, that thoſe that gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them a <hi>Cup of cold Water, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a plentiful Reward for their pains;</hi> were they in ſuch danger to be <hi>Surfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by the one, and <hi>Drunk</hi> with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and what, they like to be choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Cares of this Life, and with Carking to get what they had not, who had but juſt before renounced all that
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:105935:116"/> they had to follow Chriſt? Yea, but Chriſt knew, that even in theſe poor abſtemious <hi>Diſciples,</hi> there was a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proneneſs to Gluttony, and Rioting, and Drunkenneſs, and therefore he thus Exhorts them, and he doth it, that Grace may keep them from enclining to theſe Sins, as their Low and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Condition ſhould be ſure to keep them from committing them. So alſo the <hi>Apostle</hi> in <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 3.5. ſpeaking to them that ſhould certainly <hi>appear with Chriſt in Glory,</hi> as you may ſee in <hi>verſe</hi> 4. yet theſe he commands <hi>to Mortifie their Members that were upon the Earth:</hi> Well, but what Members are theſe, it may be they are only vanity and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of Thoughts, levity and unfix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of Affections, deadneſs and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineſs of Heart, and ſuch other leſs Sins, that ſhould they be perfectly free from, they ſhould be perfectly Holy: No, ſays the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> theſe Members are the big Limbs of the Old Man, they are <hi>Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Affections, Evil Concupiſcence,</hi> and <hi>Covetuouſneſs.</hi> And in <hi>verſe</hi> 8. he Exhorts them again <hi>to put off all theſe things, Anger, Wrath, Malice, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:105935:117"/> Filthy Communication,</hi> and <hi>Lying,</hi> and ſo he goes on reckoning up foul and horrid Sins, and Exhorts them to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie theſe Sins who were to <hi>appear with Chriſt in Glory,</hi> thoſe who never Lived in them, not at leaſt after their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; is it not ſtrange, that ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Chriſtians as theſe were, ſhould need Exhortations againſt ſuch foul Sins? Why, there's many a Perſon in a ſtate of Nature that would count their <hi>Morals</hi> much wronged, if you ſhould be offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly importunate with them not to commit <hi>Adultery,</hi> or <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> not to be <hi>Covetous,</hi> or <hi>Drunkards,</hi> or the like, this they would look upon as an Injury done to them, that you ſhould ſuſpect ſuch things as theſe are of them, would not they ſay, as <hi>Hazael</hi> did to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, What are thy Servants dogs, that they ſhould do ſuch great things as theſe are?</hi> But the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> knew that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the beſt were too ſtrong, even to thoſe Sins that a perfect Moraliſt would think ſcorn that they ſhould be ſuſpected of, and therefore he Exhorts them with all earneſtneſs, and frequent importunity, to <hi>Mortifie</hi> ſuch foul Sins as theſe are.</p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:105935:117"/>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">From the irritating Power of the Law.</note> 
                     <hi>It appears alſo from the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritating power that the Law hath.</hi> Even in the beſt of God's Children there is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally through our Corruption ſuch a Malign influence (if I may ſo call it,) in the Holy, Juſt, and Good Law of God, that inſtead of quelling Sin it doth the more enrage and provoke it, and this we call the irritating power of the Law. Thus the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us in <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.11, 13. <hi>That Sin takes occaſion by the Law to work in us all manner of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence.</hi> Why, now were it poſſible that Sin ſhould grow ſtrong by that Law that was given on purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it, but that there is in us violent propenſions towards what is forbidden us, and eager deſires after that which God hath denied us: So ſtrangely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved are our Corrupt Natures, that we ſwell with our Yoke, and labour to throw off whatever may lay a reſtraint upon us; like Green Sticks which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bent one way, by natural ſtrength we ſtart as far back the other way. Can none of us call to mind ſome Sins that poſſibly we ſhould never have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, had they not been forbidden to us; the Command often-times gives
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:105935:118"/> Corruption a hint in what &amp; how it may offend God: And is not this therefore a clear demonſtration of that mighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that there is in all of us unto Sin, when that Law that forbids Sin ſhall prove an incentive to it. The more will a high mettled Horſe foam and fling the harder you Rein him in. And if you ſtop a River in its courſe, it will riſe and ſwell till it over-flows its Banks; and whence is this, but becauſe there is a Natural Proneneſs in it to run towards the Sea: And when God caſts his Law before Men as a ſtop to them in their ſinful courſe, they ſwell the higher till they have born or over-flown all thoſe Bounds and Dams that God hath ſet to Bound them in: And whence proceeds all this, but only becauſe there is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendency and propenſion in Men's Hearts to Sin, and therefore the more they are oppoſed the higher ſtill do our Corruptions ſwell, and the more do they rage; and although the force of this ſinful propenſion may be in ſome of God's Children in a good meaſure bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, yet in the very beſt of them is there ſome degree or other of this <hi>irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating power of the Law</hi> to ſtir them up
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:105935:118"/> to Sin, even by forbidding of them to Sin. And that's the laſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The next thing propounded,<note place="margin">Whence it is that Chriſtians have a proneneſs in them unto every Sin.</note> was to enquire into the <hi>Original Cauſe whence this ſinful inclination proceeds; how it comes to paſs that there is in all Men, and even in the beſt Chriſtians, ſuch a ſtrong propenſion unto Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in the enquiry into this, I ſhall lead you on gradually by theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſteps.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> In Man's firſt Creation the Will had in it a Natural Power to determine the Specification of its own Acts, that is, freely to ſway it ſelf either unto Good, or Evil, which of them it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and if there was any Biaſs in it to draw it more one way than another, as ſome there was, it was an inclination to that which is Good; for Man's Faculties were then entire and perfect, his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg clear to diſcern what was his chief Good, and his higheſt Happineſs, his Will free to chooſe it, and his Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ready to embrace and claſp about
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:105935:119"/> it: His Love, his Fear, his Joy, his Delight, were all of them Centred in God; that which is now in us from Grace, was in him from Nature: Since the Fall we need a Twofold aſſiſtance, one a <hi>Common influence and aſſiſtance,</hi> ſuch as is vouchſafed to all Men to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them to the performance of the common and ordinary Actions of this Life, it is from God's immediate influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that we are enabled to Move, to Think, to Speak, <hi>for in him we Live, Move, and have our Beings.</hi> And then we need alſo a <hi>Special influence</hi> vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed only to the Children of God, whereby we are enabled to perform Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Spiritual Actions, as to Love, Fear, and Obey God ſincerely, and this <hi>Special influence</hi> we commonly call <hi>Grace,</hi> whereby we are enabled to Act Divinely and Spiritually: Now the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt <hi>Common</hi> and <hi>Special in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi> lies in this, that what God works in us by a <hi>Common influence,</hi> that is wrought without any grudg or reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Man's Nature to the contrary, but what is wrought in us by a <hi>Special in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,</hi> that is, brought to paſs, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture gain-ſaying and contradicting it,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:105935:119"/> thus when God enables a Sinner to Act Faith, or Love, or any Divine and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Grace, this is contrary to the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of Corrupt Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is called <hi>Special Grace.</hi> Now while Man ſtood in the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, there was nothing in his Nature that contradicted his Fear of God, his Dependance on God, or his Love to God, and therefore to enable him to Act all theſe, he needed no <hi>Special influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of <hi>Special Grace,</hi> but only of a common and ordinary Providence. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fall, <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood in no need at all of any ſuch thing as <hi>Special Grace,</hi> as we now ſtand in need of, but the ſame aſſiſtance of God, for the kind of it, that enabled him to Move, or to Speak, or to Think, was ſufficient alſo to enable him to perform the moſt Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Obedience, becauſe then the moſt Spiritual Obedience was no more to him, than thoſe Actions which we call Natural, as Eating, and Drinking, Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Walking, and Thinking, are to us now, and therefore he required no more aſſiſtance from God for the performance of Spiritual Obedience, than we now require from God for our Natural Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:105935:120"/> Now as he had this perfection of power to perform what was good, ſo he had a proneneſs of will alſo to it; but yet in that proneneſs there was not <hi>perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:</hi> He might, as afterwards he did, turn aſide from God unto <hi>Satan,</hi> and notwithſtanding his inclination to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and proneneſs to that which was Good, yet having not a <hi>perſeverance</hi> in that proneneſs, but being Lord over his own Will, as he was over the reſt of the viſible Creation, he voluntarily and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſented to the Commiſſion of Sin.</p>
                  <p>Why now, <hi>Secondly,</hi> This voluntary inclination of <hi>Adam</hi> to Sin, hath ever ſince by a dreadful, yet righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of God, brought upon all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity a natural and neceſſary inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto Sin; ſo that now, either what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they do is Sin, or there is Sin in whatever they do. Now that we may clearly apprehend how <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Sin and Provocation committed ſo many Thouſand Years ago, cauſes ſuch ſtrong propenſions to Sin in all his Poſterity, you muſt obſerve theſe following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:105935:120"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider this, that we and all Mankind were in <hi>Adam,</hi> not only as in our common Parent, from whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived our Being, but as in our <hi>Common Head, Surety, and Repreſentative,</hi> from whom we were to receive either our well or our ill Being; he was the Head of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> both he and we were Parties in the <hi>Covenant,</hi> he obeying, we obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and he ſinning, we tranſgreſſed; what he did as in this <hi>publick capacity,</hi> was not alone his Perſonal Act, but it was ours alſo. Now what Right <hi>Adam</hi> had to Indent for his Poſterity, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to the Terms of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> I have long ſince opened to you on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion, and I ſhall therefore paſs it by now.</p>

While the Soul enjoyed the <hi>Image of God,</hi> it ſought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to do all in reference unto God, but now that it hath loſt that <hi>Image</hi> it cannot any longer raiſe up its Actions to a ſuitableneſs to the Will of God, and therefore now it ſinks them, and ſeeks only to pleaſe its own Carnal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Appetite. Take the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of it in Two or Three Words: The Nature of the Soul makes it prone and inclined to Act, for it is a buſie active Creature, and if it Acts it muſt Sin, becauſe it hath not the Image of God to raiſe its Actions to a Holy and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:105935:122"/> Divine conformity to the Will of God; and therefore now to be prone to act is to be prone to ſin; and this is the true ground of that ſtrong Propenſion that is in all Men, to that which is evil and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:105935:148"/> pity to Sinners, that are very Mad-men, that fetters and chains them up, and lays ſuch a powerful reſtraint upon them by his <hi>Providence,</hi> that where their wills are not defective, yet their power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Sin, ſhould be. What would wicked men think, if God ſhould now ſuddenly ſtrike them <hi>dumb,</hi> or <hi>blind,</hi> or <hi>lame,</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent?</hi> would they not judge this a heavy Judgment inflicted upon them? they would ſo; and yet believe it, it were better for them that God ſhould ſtrike them dumb upon the place, than that they ſhould ever open their Mouths more to blaſpheme and rail at God and his People; better they were ſtruck blind, than that the <hi>Devil</hi> and vile Luſts ſhould enter into the Soul by thoſe Caſements; better that God ſhould maim them, than that they ſhould have ſtrength to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thoſe Sins, that if but will'd, will damn them; but if executed, will ſink their Souls ſeven-fold deeper into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Now the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> by taking away ther power, prevents their wickedneſs, and ſo mercifully mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigates their condemnation.</p>

                  <p>There are doubtleſs many other vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and myſterious <hi>Providences,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God hinders the Sins of Men; but theſe are the moſt common and moſt remarkable ways, by ſhortning their Lives, by leſſening their Power, by raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up another Power to oppoſe them, by diverting another way, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the Objects of their Sins.</p>
                  <p>The next Thing is, to ſhew you how God hinders the commiſſion of Sin in a way of Grace; but I ſhall leave this till another time, and make ſome Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what hath now been ſpoken.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt then, <hi>See here the ſad and woful Eſtate of wicked men, whom Grace doth not change, but only Providence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain.</hi>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:105935:150"/> A mere reſtraint from Sin, when the Heart continues fully ſet and bent upon it, muſt needs cauſe torment and vexation; their own Corruptions urge them forward; but <hi>God's Providence,</hi> that meets them, and croſſes them at every turn, and that diſappointment that they meet with, when they fully reſolve upon Sin, cauſes great vexation of Spirit; as God will torment them hereafter for their Sins, ſo he torments them here, by keeping them from their Sins. All the wicked in the world are ſtrangely hampered by <hi>God's Providence,</hi> as ſo many <hi>Bulls</hi> in a <hi>Net,</hi> that though they ſtruggle, yet they cannot poſſibly break through; and by their ſtrugling, they only vex and weary themſelves. God doth, as it were, give up the hearts of wicked men to the <hi>Devil,</hi> only he ties their hands; let them intend and imagine as much Evil and Miſchief as they can, yea, as much as <hi>Hell</hi> can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire into them, yet none of theſe ſhall execute any of it otherwiſe than as God permits them. Now, if there be any real pleaſure in Sin, it is in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; that which men take in plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and contriving of it, is merely the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:105935:151"/> delight of a Dream and Fancy; and herein lies the exceeding wretchedneſs of wicked men, that though <hi>Providence</hi> almightily hinders them in the execution of Sin, yet Juſtice will juſtly puniſh their intention and plotting of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This ſhould teach us to adore and magnnfie this Sin-preventing Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God.</hi> Our Lives, our Eſtates, yea, whatever is dear &amp; precious to us hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, have been ſecured to us only by his powerful hand, which hath curb'd in the unruly Luſts of men, and kept them from breaking forth into violence, and blood, and rapine. Should God ſlack the Reins, ſhould he throw them upon the necks of ungodly men, how would Uproars, and Confuſions, Murders, and Slaughters overſpread the face of the whole Earth, and make the World a <hi>Hell</hi> above ground. <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> are two wonderful Works of God; by the one he pardons Sin that is committed, and by the other, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents Sin, leſt it be committed; both of them are Contrivances of infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and both of them are unſearchable, and paſt finding out; and therefore we
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:105935:151"/> ought to aſcribe the Glory of both unto God, that hath laid both the Deſign of <hi>Redemption</hi> and of <hi>Providence</hi> for Man's Good, and for Man's Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>If at any time we can recall to mind, as indeed who is there that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, that God hath thus by his Providence prevented us from the commiſſion of Sin, how ſhould this oblige us thankfully to own this Mercy of God to us?</hi> May not all of us ſay, had not God taken away our power, had he not taken away the Objects of our Luſts, had he not divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us ſome other way, we had now been deeply engaged in thoſe Sins that the <hi>merciful Providence</hi> of God hath divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from? He it was that hedged up the broad way with Thorns, that ſo he might turn us into the narrow way that leads unto eternal Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Hath God's Providence ſo many Ways and Methods to hinder the Commiſſion of Sin, why then we may be aſſured that he will never permit it, but when it ſhall redound to his own Praiſe and Glory.</hi> It is an excellent Saying of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:105935:152"/> S. <hi>Auſtin, He that is moſt good will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer evil unleſs he were alſo moſt wiſe; whereby he is able to bring good out of evil.</hi> And therefore when we ſee wicked men let alone to accompliſh their helliſh deſigns, we may then quiet our ſelves with this, God knows how to make his own advantage out of their wickedneſs; he knows how from ſuch Dung and Filth to reap a moſt fruitful Crop of Glory to himſelf: <hi>The Rage of Man,</hi> ſays the <hi>Pſalmist, thou wilt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain, and the reſidue thereof ſhall turn to thy praiſe;</hi> that wickedneſs which God doth not reſtrain, he will make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to his own Praiſe and Glory.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, <hi>This may eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh our hearts in peace, when we ſee the wickedneſs of Men moſt raging and violent, why they cannot ſin unleſs God gives them a power;</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> told <hi>Pilate, Thou haſt no power over me,</hi> in <hi>John</hi> 19.10. <hi>except it be given thee from above.</hi> And certainly that God that gives them a power to ſin, ſtill keeps a power in his own hands to limit them in their Sins; and when their Luſts are moſt unruly, he can ſay to them, hitherto ſhall ye
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:105935:152"/> go, and here ſhall your proud Waves be ſtayed: He ſtints them and bounds them, and he alſo can totally reſtrain them when he pleaſeth, and when it ſhall be moſt for his own Praiſe and Glory.</p>
                  <p>Now as God doth thus keep Men back from the commiſſion of <hi>Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Sins</hi> by a ſtrong hand of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi> So ſometimes he doth by his Grace, and this Grace is either meerly reſtraining, or elſe it is ſanctifying and renewing; both of them are of very great force and efficacy, by the one he holds Men back from Sin, and by the other he turns them againſt Sin. You have doubtleſs heard much concerning <hi>Sanctifying</hi> and <hi>Reſtraining Grace,</hi> but yet that your Notions and Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of them may be more clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, I ſhall give you the difference that there is betwixt theſe two in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral particulars;<note place="margin">How re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining &amp; renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace do differ.</note> they differ in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, they differ in their Eſſence, and in their manner of Operation.</p>

And as Chriſt ſpeaks of the Church of <hi>Pergamos,</hi> it dwells there where <hi>Satan's Seat</hi> is, it rules in the midſt of its Enemies, and it is engaged ſo to do for its own ſecurity, that it may ſtill cruſh them as they ariſe in the Heart.

<pb n="293" facs="tcp:105935:159"/> and affection of the Soul againſt another; but where <hi>ſanctifying Grace</hi> hinders it, it ſets the ſame faculty and affection of the Soul againſt it ſelf; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining Grace</hi> ſets one affection againſt another, Conſcience againſt Will, the fear of Hell againſt the love of Sin, hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh terrors againſt ſinful pleaſures, God's threatnings againſt the <hi>Devil's</hi> flatteries, it martials up theſe, and ſo enters the combat; here are bandyings of one power of the Soul againſt another, but now the <hi>Will</hi> that is entirely on ſins part, and if <hi>Conſcience</hi> prevails and pulls away a beloved luſt from the embraces of the <hi>Will,</hi> the Sinner parts with it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heavily and unwillingly, following it as <hi>Phaltiel</hi> did <hi>Michal</hi> weeping, tho he durſt not make reſiſtance; but now when <hi>ſanctifying Grace</hi> oppoſeth and hinders ſin, it ſets the ſame faculty and affection of the Soul againſt it ſelf, Will againſt Will, and Love againſt Love, Deſire againſt Deſire; he wills the commiſſion of ſin, it is true, but yet at the ſame time he wills the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; he loves to gratifie his ſin, but yet at the ſame time he wills the croſſing of it too; he deſires to enjoy
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:105935:160"/> that pleaſure and contentment, that he fanſies he may take in ſin, and yet he deſires at the ſame time to deſtroy it; here is one and the ſame faculty bandy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt it ſelf, and the reaſon of this is, becauſe a Child of God hath two Principles in every ſingle faculty; there is in him a mixture of Fleſh and Spirit; a carnal part that ſides with ſin, and a ſpiritual part that always contradicts and oppoſeth it, and theſe two are ſpread over his whole Soul, and are mingled with every power and faculty thereof; ſo that he can neither do the evil nor do the good, that he would do without contradiction, ſtrife, and reluctancy; now try your ſelves by this when you are tempted to ſin, what is it that reſiſts it? Is it your <hi>Will,</hi> or is it only your <hi>Conſcience?</hi> are you only frighted from it, doth the fear of <hi>Hell</hi> overcome the love of ſin; why? all this may be from a mere <hi>reſtraint</hi> in thoſe, who are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unacquainted with the power of <hi>ſanctifying Grace;</hi> this is the ſymptom and Character of a gracious Soul, that when it is moſt inclinable unto ſin, yet at the ſame time is moſt averſe from it, when it moſt wiſheth the accompliſhment of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:105935:160"/> ſin; yet even then it ſtrongly wiſhes the ſubduing and mortifying of that ſin; I know this appears a <hi>Riddle</hi> and a ſtrange <hi>Paradox</hi> to wicked Men, but thoſe who have any true ſenſe of the work of Grace upon their own hearts, know it to be a truth, and rejoyce in the experiences that they have of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>Reſtraining and ſanctifying Grace differ in the motives and arguments, that they make uſe of for the reſiſting of ſin;</hi> there are two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Topicks</hi> or common places, whence all arguments againſt ſin are drawn, and thoſe are the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> both of theſe adminiſter ſuch weapons, that if rightly uſed, are very effectual for the beating down of ſin, and commonly <hi>reſtraining Grace</hi> uſeth thoſe only that are borrowed from the <hi>Law;</hi> it urgeth the command, it thunders the curſe, it brandiſheth the ſword of Juſtice, and makes reports of nothing but Hell and eternal Damnation, and ſuch like argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ſcare Men from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of their ſins, though ſtill they love them; now <hi>ſanctifying Grace</hi> though it alſo makes a moſt profitable uſe of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:105935:161"/> theſe very arguments, yet it chiefly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth more mild and more ingenious motives drawn from the love of God, from the Death of Chriſt, from the comforts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and theſe though they ſtrike ſofter, yet they wound deeper; now hereby alſo you may give a gueſs, whether your abſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſin, be merely from <hi>reſtraining</hi> or from <hi>ſanctifying Grace,</hi> obſerve what weapons you uſe? What conſiderations do over-awe your hearts? Are they ſuch as are drawn only from the <hi>Law,</hi> and the ſad reflections of the end and iſſue of ſin? That it brings <hi>Shame,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> muſt you run down to <hi>Hell</hi> every time a temptation comes to fetch arguments thence to oppoſe againſt your corruptions? can you no where elſe quench the <hi>fiery Darts</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be in that Lake of Fire? if this be all (though this too is well) yet know if it be all, this is no more than what <hi>reſtraint and common Grace</hi> may perform; it is the proper character of <hi>reſtraining Grace,</hi> to keep Men back from the commiſſion of ſin only by dread and fear of puniſhment; but now <hi>ſanctifying Grace,</hi> that eſpecially betakes
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:105935:161"/> it ſelf to <hi>Goſpel Arguments,</hi> and conſiders how diſingenious it is to ſin againſt a reconciled and a gracious Father, againſt a crucified and a bleeding Saviour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a patient and long ſuffering Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and heaps up many ſuch like inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious arguments that work kindly upon the heart; he leads every temptation to the Croſs of Chriſt, and there ſhews it his <hi>Saviour</hi> hanging and bleeding and can I commit this ſin, that hath drawn ſo much blood from my <hi>Saviour</hi> to expiate it, and would draw ſo much blood from my <hi>Conſcience</hi> to perpetrate it? did he die to free me from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of it, and ſhall I wilfully ruſh into the commiſſion of it? no, <hi>O Lord,</hi> thy love withholds me, I cannot do this thing and ſin againſt ſo rich, ſo free, and infinite Mercy and Goodneſs, that thou dayly extendeſt towards me. Thus true Grace uſually teacheth a Child of God to argue againſt his ſins; and this keeps him from the commiſſion of thoſe ſins, that others riſing up againſt them, only from the terrors and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the <hi>Law,</hi> and other ſuch dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſiderations, fall into notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; a <hi>Wooll-pack</hi> ſooner damps a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:105935:162"/> elſe would lie ſluggiſh and dormant in the Soul. <hi>Habitual Grace</hi> that deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates the Soul alive unto God, but yet it is no otherwiſe alive than a Man in a Swoon is, it is <hi>exciting Grace,</hi> that alone can enable it to perform the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Offices of Life; in the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Winter, there is life in the ſeed that lies buried under ground, but yet it acts not till the <hi>Sun's influence</hi> draws it forth, and then it heaves and ſhoves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Earth that covered it, and ſpreads it ſelf into the beauties of a Flower: So is it here, <hi>inherent habitual Grace</hi> is an immortal ſeed, and it is but a ſeed till the influences of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exciting Grace of God awaken it, and chafe it's benumbed vertue, and then it ſtirs and thruſts away all that dung and filth of corruptions under which it lay buried, and then it flows forth into <hi>actual Grace;</hi> habitual and exciting Grace muſt both concurr to the producing of actual Grace, as neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as there muſt be the concurrence both of the heat of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and of life in the ſeed to produce a Flower; now by God's <hi>exciting,</hi> inherent, <hi>habitual</hi> Grace in the Soul, he keeps Men from ſinning two ways.</p>

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:105935:163"/> Grace, whereby we have not only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a duty, but alſo eſcaped ſome ſoul and notorious Sin, that we might have committed had we not been ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily employed; we who are here now preſent before the Lord this day, had we neglected this preſent opportunity, who of us knows, what horrid tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and foul ſins, we might have been expoſed to in our <hi>own Houſes,</hi> which in the <hi>Houſe of God</hi> we have avoided. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> when he walked idly upon the roof of his Houſe, he lies open to the Snares of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and ſins foully; had he then been at his <hi>Harp</hi> or <hi>Pſalms,</hi> he might thereby have driven the <hi>Evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> from himſelf, as formerly he did from his Maſter <hi>Saul; running Streams</hi> preſerve themſelves pure and clean, when <hi>ſtanding Pools</hi> ſoon grow corrupt and noiſome, and venomous creatures breed in them; ſo is it with the heart, whileſt God's exciting and quickning Grace, puts it upon continual act, it is preſerved from corruption; but when once it grows ſluggiſh, and doth not freely flow forth into the actings of Grace and performance of Duties, the ſpawn of all manner of ſin breeds there,

<pb n="301" facs="tcp:105935:164" rendition="simple:additions"/> on, yet is of it ſelf ſo feeble, that it can make no oppoſition till a kindly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> calls out ſome particular Grace that is directly contrary to that Sin that ſtirs, and this reſiſts and ſubdues it. This Method God uſed in keeping the Apoſtle from ſinning, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. He was there under a ſharp and pungent <hi>Temptation;</hi> that is therefore called a <hi>Thorn in the Fleſh, v.</hi> 7. Satan buffets, and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> prays; and God anſwers, <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee:</hi> My Grace is ſufficient, not thy Grace; that Grace that is in thee, is but weak and helpleſs; yea, a very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if I withdraw my influence from it; but that quickning Grace that flows from me, that alone is ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Temptation, and to prevent the Sin. Why, now while God's <hi>exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace</hi> work'd upon the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Grace,</hi> this Temptation, this <hi>Thorn</hi> in the Fleſh only made him more watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and more induſtrious againſt it; but if God ſhould have ſuſpended this his Influence, this Thorn in the Fleſh would immediately, notwithſtanding all his Grace, ſadly have wounded his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by the commiſſion of ſome great
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:105935:165"/> and foul Sin. Now, as all manner of Sin lies couched in that <hi>Body of Sin</hi> that we bear about with us; ſo all manner of Grace lies couched in that <hi>Principle of Grace</hi> that God implants in his own Children. Now, when the <hi>Devil</hi> by his <hi>Temptations</hi> calls forth ſome particular Sin, God alſo at the ſame time by his <hi>exciting Grace</hi> calls forth a particular Grace, to hinder the commiſſion of that Sin. Thus, when they are tempted to Pride, God calls forth Humility to prick that ſwelling, puffing Bladder; when they are tempted to Wrath and Paſſion, he ſtirs up Meekneſs; when to murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and repining againſt the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, he puts Patience upon its perfect work. Briefly, there is no Sin whatever that the <hi>Devil</hi> can by his Temptation ſtir up in the Heart, but <hi>God</hi> alſo can ſtir up a contrary Grace to it, to quell and maſter it. This is the Method of God's <hi>exciting Grace</hi> in the preventing of Sin, that when the <hi>Devil</hi> calls forth a particular Corruption out of the Stock of Corruption, God calls forth a particular Grace, contrary to it, from the Stock of Grace. But yet there are ſome particular Graces that are more
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:105935:165"/> eſpecially employed about this Service, and which God doth moſt frequently exerciſe, and ſet on work to keep his Children from the commiſſion of Sin.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God hinders the commiſſion of ſin by keeping up the lively and vigorous actings of Faith.</hi> Indeed if Faith fail, all other Graces muſt fail by conſequence. Faith is the Soul's Steward, that fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Supplies of Grace from Chriſt, in whom is the Treaſure of it, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes them to all the other Graces of the Soul. Therefore when Chriſt tells St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Satan had deſired to ſift him</hi> by his Temptations, leſt he ſhould be thereby diſcouraged and dejected, preſently he adds, in <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>But I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not:</hi> And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Faith, rather than any other Grace, but becauſe other Graces muſt take their Lot with Faith, and muſt be ſtrong or weak, victorious or languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Faith is; and therefore it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Shield of Faith,</hi> Epheſ. 6.6. Now the Office of a <hi>Shield</hi> is to defend, not only the Body, but the reſt of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour alſo; and ſo doth <hi>Faith,</hi> when it is dexterouſly managed, it keeps both
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:105935:166"/> the Soul, and its Graces alſo from the Attempts of the <hi>Devil.</hi> I might be large here in ſhewing you how Faith preſerves from Sin; as, by deriving vertue and ſtrength from the Death and Blood of Chriſt; by pleading God's Engagements and Promiſes to <hi>tread Satan under our feet;</hi> by urging and importuning Chriſt to fulfill in us the end of his coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, which was to deſtroy the Works of the <hi>Devil;</hi> and many ſuch Ways I might name, by which Faith prevents Sin, and deſtroys it; but wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, I ſhall only mention two Particulars, wherein this energy of Faith in keeping Men from Sin, is the moſt conſpicuous.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Faith preſerves from Sin, by bringing in, and preſenting to the Soul eternal Rewards and Puniſhments;</hi> and that's the peculiar Office of <hi>Faith:</hi> Theſe indeed are future unto Senſe, but they are preſent unto <hi>Faith;</hi> for <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. It gives them a Being before they are; and what we hope for or fear, as to come, by Faith it is enjoyed, or felt, as already preſent. Why now, what a
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:105935:166"/> mighty advantage is this to preſerve men from ſinning? Would Sinners treat with the <hi>Devil,</hi> or hearken to a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, if they ſhould now ſee the whole World on flame, <hi>Angels</hi> haſtning them to Judgment, and Chriſt upon his Throne; here <hi>Heaven,</hi> to receive and crown them; there <hi>Hell,</hi> with all its horrours, to torment them; would any of you dare to ſin, if all this were before your eyes? Why, believe it, when <hi>Faith</hi> acts lively, all this is as truly preſent to the Soul, as it is certain it ſhall once be; and therefore no more than we would commit a Sin if Sentence were now paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon us, either of Abſolution, or of eternal Damnation at the Judgment-Seat of God, no more ſhall we ſin while Faith ſets theſe things evidently before our eyes, and makes them as real to us as they are ſure.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Faith preſerves from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by repreſenting that God, who muſt hereafter be our Judge, to be now our Spectator and Obſerver.</hi> It is only an Eye of Faith that can diſcover things fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as preſent, and things ſpiritual as real: Why now, God he is a ſpiritual
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:105935:167"/> Being, and therefore is inviſible to the dull eyes of Fleſh; but the quick Eye of Faith, that can <hi>ſee him who is inviſible;</hi> as it was ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> Heb. 11.27. it fixeth its eye upon the all-ſeeing eye of God, and fills the Soul with awful Thoughts of God's Omni-preſence and Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, that all things are naked and bare before him, in whoſe company we are where-ever we are, and with whom we have to do whatever we are doing: Why now, conſider with your ſelves, Would I commit ſuch or ſuch a Sin, to which poſſibly you are tempted, if ſome grave perſon were in the room with you whom you did much reſpect? And what, ſhall the Preſence of a <hi>mortal Man</hi> keep you from ſinning, and ſhall not the Preſence of the <hi>Great God</hi> much more? Shall we dare to ſin, when God's eye is fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, when he views not only our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Actions, but alſo our inward Thoughts, clearer than we can ſee the faces one of another? It was the wiſe Counſel that a <hi>Heathen-Man</hi> gave to a <hi>Scholar</hi> of his, That if he would preſerve himſelf from doing any thing that was undecent, he ſhould ſuppoſe ſome ſober and reverend man preſent with him;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:105935:167"/> and this would keep him from doing that which he would be aſhamed to do before him. Truly, we need not make any ſuch Suppoſition; the great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God is preſent with us in reality, and the eye of Faith diſcovers him ſo to be; he is always looking on us: yea, always looking into us; and certainly this, to one that can exerciſe the diſcerning eye of Faith, will be a more effectual means to keep a man from Sin, than if all the eyes of Men and Angels were upon him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As the exerciſe of Faith, ſo the ſprightly and vigorous exerciſe of Divine Love is an excellent Preſervative againſt Sin.</hi> Love will not willingly do any thing that may offend and grieve the Object loved. <hi>Love,</hi> it is an aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating Affection, it is the very Cement that joyns God and the Soul together in the ſame Spirit, and makes them to be of one heart, and of one mind; it is the Load-ſtone of the Soul, that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all other Affections, and makes them ſtand heaven-ward: When once God hath wrought the Love of himſelf in our hearts, this will conſtrain us to love what
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:105935:168"/> he loves, and to hate what he hates; Sin is the only thing that God hates, and thoſe that love him will not, cannot but hate Sin; their love to God will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them to do it, Pſalm 97 7. <hi>Ye that love the Lord hate evil.</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the hatred of evil is the beſt ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt the committing of it; will any one take a <hi>Toad</hi> or <hi>Serpent</hi> into his boſome to lodge it there? Truly as utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible it is while the <hi>Exciting Grace</hi> of God, ſtirs up and quickens our <hi>Love</hi> to him, that we ſhould ever embrace a vile luſt and lodge it in our hearts ſince our ſight of the beauty of Holineſs hath made it ugly, and our love to God hath made it hateful.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To mention no more, <hi>A Holy Fear and Caution leaſt we ſhould Sin is a moſt excellent preſervative againſt Sin.</hi> None are ſo ſafe as thoſe that are leaſt ſecure, fear is the beſt preſervative of Grace, whereas thoſe that are raſh and venturous and confident of their own ſtrength, run themſelves into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Temptations, and come off with wounded and ſmarting Conſciences. <hi>Stand in awe,</hi> ſays, the <hi>Pſalmiſt, and Sin
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:105935:168"/> not,</hi> Pſalm 4.4. The timorous and trembling Chriſtian ſtands firmeſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a one is apt upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſuſpect his own ſtrength, and to call in God's. And indeed, when we conſider the treachery of our own Hearts, and the ſubtilty of the <hi>Devil,</hi> this <hi>Holy Fear</hi> and Jealouſie is no more than is needful, and it is leſs than ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. A Man that is to wade thorough a deep River, will firſt try his Footing before he takes his ſtep: Why, we are to wade thorough the <hi>depths of Satan,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls them, and, certainly it is but a requiſite caution firſt to try our ground before we venture upon it, to look about and conſider whether ſuch and ſuch an Action be grounded upon a <hi>Command,</hi> and ſecured to us by a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> whether if we do it we ſhall not lay our ſelves open to ſuch and ſuch Temptations, or if we do lie open to them, whether or not we are in God's way, and may expect his Protection and Preſervation: Truly ſuch circumſpection as this is will prove our beſt ſecurity, and though we are not able by all our own ſtrength and diligence to preſerve our ſelves, yet when God ſees us ſo induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:105935:169"/> ſolicitous to avoid Sin, he will then come in by his Almighty Grace that helps not the Sloathful, but the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, and he will keep us from thoſe Sins that we cannot keep our ſelves from.</p>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>Application</hi> of this, if it be ſo that it is the Almighty Power of God only that can keep us from Sin, <hi>This may then be Convictive of that Errour that now a Days is very rife in the World, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes our preſervation in our ſtanding, not ſo much to the Almighty Grace of God, as to the Liberty and Freedom of our own Wills.</hi> Truly this is an Opinion that proceeds much from the Pride and Stomach of ſuch who are loath to be too much beholding to the Grace of God for their Salvation. It is true, no Man Sins, nor no Man abſtains from Sin, but it is with his Will, but yet ſtill there is an Almighty Influence from God, an Influence of common Providence to the Wicked, without which they could not ſo much as Will, and an Influence of Special Grace to the Godly, without which they could not abſtain from Sin: <hi>It is God,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, that works
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:105935:169"/> in us both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure;</hi> it is not, whether or not the <hi>Will</hi> be free in abſtaining from Sin that is acknowledged, but whether the motion of the Will be principally and primarily from God, or from it ſelf; and this the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> concludes to be from God. From him it is that we <hi>both will and do;</hi> he gives the firſt beginning, he adds the progreſs, and he concludes. He firſt begets Grace, then he encreaſeth it, and at laſt he crowns it. All is from God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This may inſtruct us to whom we ought to aſcribe the Praiſe and the Glory of our Preſervation from thoſe foul and horrid Sins that we ſee others daily fall into.</hi> Not unto us, <hi>O Lord,</hi> not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, but unto <hi>thy Name</hi> be <hi>all the Praiſe and Glory.</hi> We have Natures as ſinful as the worſt of Men ever had, and that ſuch ſinful Natures ſhould not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as wicked Lives, whence proceeds this, but only from the <hi>Miracle of God's Grace,</hi> for it is a <hi>Miracle,</hi> that when the Fountain is as bitter, when our Hearts are as bad as the Hearts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet the ſtreams ſhould not be ſo?
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:105935:170"/> Whence is it, ſince we have the ſame <hi>Corrupt Hearts</hi> with <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and all the Wicked Rabble in the World, whence is it that we have not commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame Impieties with them, or worſe than they have done? Why, God hath either <hi>Reſtrained</hi> or <hi>Sanctified</hi> us, But Sanctifying Grace is not enough, for whence is it that we have not been <hi>Drunken</hi> with <hi>Noah, Adulterers</hi> or <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> Abjurers of Chriſt with <hi>Peter?</hi> are we more Holy than they, or are we more Sanctified than they? No, it is only our gracious God's vouchſafing to us a conſtant influence of <hi>Exciting Grace,</hi> that hath thus kept us from thoſe Sins into which he ſuffers Wicked Men to fall, and not only them, but ſometimes his own dear Children too: It is not a difference in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is not a difference from inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Grace within us, that makes this difference in our Lives, but it is only a difference from the unaccountable Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Influencing Grace of God, there lies the difference. Well then, <hi>let not the ſtrong Man glory in his ſtrength, but let him that glorieth glory in the Lord,</hi> for he is our ſtrength and our deliverer. <hi>What
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:105935:170"/> have we that we have not received, and if we have received, why do we boaſt as though we had not received?</hi> it is not what we have of our ſelves, but it is what we have received from God, and what we do daily receive in a way of ſpecial influence, that makes us to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Vileſt and moſt Profligate Sinners in the World, and therefore let us aſcribe the Glory of all to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Powerful Grace of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To ſhut up all, <hi>If our preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from Sin be from God, beware then how you provoke him to withdraw and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend the influence of his Grace, whereby you have been preſerved, and ſtill are:</hi> Indeed if we belong to him, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo far depart from us as utterly to forſake us, but yet he may ſo far depart from us, as that we may have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſenſe of his preſence, nor no vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſupports from his Grace, we may be left a naked and deſtitute Prey to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Temptation, and fall into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of thoſe Sins out of which we may never be able to recover our ſelves to our former Strength, Comfort, and Stability; we may fall to the breaking
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:105935:171"/> of our Bones, and we may riſe agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> poſſibly, but it will be to the breaking of our Hearts. So much for this time and for this ſubject.</p>

Is it therefore, <hi>I am he that ſpread forth the Heavens, and martial'd all their Hoſt, that hang up the Earth in the midſt of the Air, that breath'd forth all the Creatures upon the face of it, that poured out the great Deeps, and meaſur'd them all in the hollow of my hand, that ride upon the wings of the Wind, and make the Clouds the Duſt of my Feet.</hi> This though it might awe and amuſe the hearts of Men, yet God counts it not his chiefeſt Glory;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105935:174"/> but, <hi>I, even I am he, that blotteth out Tranſgreſſion, and forgive Iniquities.</hi> So we find, when God condeſcended to ſhew <hi>Moſes</hi> his Glory, he proclaims, not the Lord Great and Terrible, that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all things by the Word of his Mouth, and can deſtroy all things by the Breath of his Noſtrils: No, but he paſſeth before him with a ſtill voice, and proclaims himſelf to be, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God Gracious and Merciful, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſin.</hi> So that when God would be ſeen in his chiefeſt State and Glory, he reveals himſelf to be a ſin-pardoning God; <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy Tranſgreſſions, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi>

                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">That ſin is written.</note> 
                     <hi>That our Tranſgreſſions are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down,</hi> and written they are in a two-fold Book; the one is in the <hi>Book of God's Remembrance,</hi> which he blots
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:105935:175"/> out when he juſtifies a ſinner: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>our own Conſciences</hi> which he blots out when he gives us peace and aſſurance; and oftentimes theſe follow one upon the other: When God blots his <hi>Remembrance-Book</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that blot diffuſeth and ſpreads it ſelf even to the <hi>Book of Conſcience,</hi> and blots out all that is written there alſo. Man blots his Conſcience by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſin, but God blots it by pardoning it: He lays a blot of Chriſt's Bloud up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a blot of our guilt, and this is ſuch a blot as leaves the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of a ſinner purer and cleaner than it found it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Blotting out of Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on implies a legal diſcharge of the Debt.</hi> A <hi>Book</hi> that is once blotted and croſſed, ſtands void in Law; whatever the Sum and Debts were before, yet the croſſing of the <hi>Book</hi> ſignifies the payment of the Debt. So is it here, <hi>I will blot out thy Tranſgreſſions;</hi> that is, I will acquit thee of all thy Debts, I will never charge them upon thee, I will daſh them all out, I will not leave ſo much as one <hi>Item,</hi> not one ſin legible againſt thee. This is the proper meaning of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105935:175"/> and Notion of blotting out of Tranſgreſſion and Sin. And this is one thing that pardon of ſin is expreſſed by.</p>
                  <p>It follows in the next words, <hi>and I will not remember thy ſins.</hi> Not that there is truly any forgetfulneſs in <hi>God;</hi> no, his Memory retains every ſin we have committed ſurer and firmer than if all our ſins were written in Leaves of Braſs; but <hi>God</hi> ſpeaks here as he doth elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where frequently in <hi>Scripture,</hi> by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Condeſcenſion, and after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Men, and it is to be interpreted only by the Effects, <hi>I will not remember their ſins;</hi> that is, I will deal ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with them, as if indeed I did not remember the leaſt of their Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I will be to them as one that hath utterly forgotten all their injuries. So, that this, <hi>not remembring of ſin,</hi> denies not the eminent Act of God's Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but only the tranſient Act of his Juſtice, and is no more than his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing not to puniſh ſin; as if God had ſaid, I will not be avenged on them, nor puniſh them for their ſins.</p>
                  <p>And here we may ſee what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſecurity God gives his People, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105935:176"/> they ſhall never be impleaded for thoſe ſins which once they have attained the pardon of; they are blotted out of his <hi>Book of Remembrance:</hi> and that they may not fear he will accuſe them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Book, he tells them, That they are utterly forgotten, and ſhall never be remembred by him againſt them any more.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſider the impulſive cauſe, that moves God's Hand, as it were, to blot out our Tranſgreſſions;</hi> and that is not any thing without himſelf, but (ſays God) <hi>I will do it for my own ſake.</hi> This admits of a two-fold ſence, effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and final.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>For my own ſake: That is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is my pleaſure:</hi> I will do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I will do it. And indeed this is the Royal Prerogative of <hi>God</hi> alone, to render his Will for his Reaſon; for becauſe his Will is altogether Soveraign, and Independent, that muſt needs be moſt reaſonable that he wills. If any ſhould queſtion, Why the Lord paſt by fallen <hi>Angels,</hi> and ſtoopt ſo low as to take up Fallen Man? And why among
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105935:176"/> Men, he hath rejected many Wiſe and Noble, and hath choſen thoſe that are mean and contemptible? Why he hath gathered up, and lodged in his own Boſom, thoſe that wallowed in the filth and defilement of the worſt ſins, when others are left to periſh under far leſs guilt? The moſt reaſonable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that can be given of all, is this, I have done it for my own ſake, I have done it becauſe it is my Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to do it; even the ſame Reaſon that <hi>God</hi> gave unto <hi>Moſes: I will be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, becauſe I will be gracious, and I will ſhew mercy, becauſe I will ſhew mercy,</hi> Exod. 33.19. Which was the ſame Anſwer our Saviour gave to himſelf, Luke 10.21. <hi>Even ſo Father, becauſe ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>For my own ſake, we may take it in a final ſenſe,</hi> that is, I will do it, becauſe of that great Honour and Glory that will accrue to my great Name by it. The ultimate, and chief end of God in all his Actions, is his own Glory. God beſtows Pardon and Salvation upon us chiefly for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his own Glory, even the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105935:177"/> Glory of his Mercy and free Grace. Our Salvation is therefore accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it might be a means to declare to the World how Merciful and Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God is; not ſo much for our good, as for his Glory; not for our ſakes, but for his own ſake. Such a Parallel place we have in Ezek. 36.12. <hi>I do not this for your ſake, ſaith the Lord, but for my Holy Name ſake, that you have profaned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen:</hi> I will ſhew mercy unto you, not ſo much that you may be delivered, as that my Holy Name that you have profaned, may be redeemed from that diſhonour that you have caſt upon it, and may be Glorified among the <hi>Heathen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus we have the full Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the words, and from them I ſhall raiſe and proſecute this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Doctrine. <hi>That the Grace of God, whereby he blots out and forgives ſin, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely free, and infinitely Glorious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out thy Tranſgreſſions for my own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:105935:177"/>
                  <p>Now though this Doctrine of free Grace hath deſerved well of all, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt tenure of our preſent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, and the beſt prop for our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hopes; yet hath it in all Ages found bitter Enemies, and of old, like the procurer of it, been Crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Thieves, the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and the <hi>Pelagian Hereticks:</hi> the <hi>Pelagians</hi> deprive it of its freedom, and enſlave it to the will of Man, affirming, That God therefore pardons and ſaves ſome, becauſe they will by the power of their own Nature work Faith in themſelves; whereas the truth is, therefore God works Faith in them, becauſe he will pardon and ſave them. Thus they make <hi>free Grace</hi> a Hand-maid to wait upon the motions of <hi>free Will.</hi> Now this is greatly derogatory to <hi>free Grace,</hi> for Men to bottom their Faith and Pardon upon the Arbitrarineſs of <hi>free Will,</hi> and not upon the Almighty Soveraign <hi>Grace</hi> of God, that firſt moves the Will to believe, and then pardons it upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving.</p>
                  <p>Now as theſe depreſs the <hi>free Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> ſo there are others that aſcribe too much unto it, of old <hi>Iſlebius,</hi> in <hi>Luther</hi>'s

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:105935:179"/> time, who was the firſt Ring-leader: Of latter days, the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> and theſe think the Grace of <hi>God</hi> is ſo <hi>free</hi> as to ſuperſede all neceſſity of working for it, or with it, and that it is enough for us to ſit ſtill and admire it, and ſo to be hurried away to Heaven in a Dream. Nay, ſome even in our days have upon this Principle arrived to that height of Blaſphemy, as to affirm, That we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much glorifie <hi>free Grace,</hi> as when we make work for it by ſtout ſinning. Now therefore that we may avoid both theſe extreams, it will be very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſtate aright, How the Grace of <hi>God</hi> is free, and how it is not free.</p>
                  <p>Now there are many ſorts of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, a freedom from natural neceſſity, a freedom from violent co-action, and from engaging promiſes, and the like; but theſe are not pertinent to our preſent buſineſs. When Grace therefore is ſaid to be free, it muſt be taken in a <hi>two-fold</hi> ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Free from any procurement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Free from any limiting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi> And accordingly I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Whether the Grace of God be ſo free, as to exclude all Merit and Deſert?</hi> And then,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Whether it be ſo free as to require no Conditions?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Whether the Grace of God be ſo free, as to exclude all Merit and Deſert?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in <hi>Anſwer</hi> unto this <hi>Queſtion,</hi> I ſhall lay down three Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">God's Grace is not ſo free as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Merits of Chriſt.</note> 
                     <hi>That the pardoning Grace of God is not ſo freely vouchſaf'd to Man, as to exclude all Merit and Deſert on Chriſt's part.</hi> There is not the leaſt ſin par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd unto any, but it firſt coſt the price of bloud, even the precious bloud of the Son of God. It is this bloud that croſſeth <hi>God</hi>'s Debt-Book, and blots out all thoſe <hi>Items</hi> that we ſtand indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him for. As Chriſt now ſues out our Pardon by his Interceſſion in Heaven; ſo he bought out our Pardon by his Sufferings on the Croſs; for, <hi>without ſhedding of bloud, there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:105935:180"/> Hebr. 9.22. <hi>And this is my bloud,</hi> ſays our Saviour himſelf, <hi>which is ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Matth. 26.28. <hi>And we are not our own, but we are bought with a price, even with the precious bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, as of a Lamb without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, and without ſpot,</hi> as the two great <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſpeak, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. Some have made bold, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with no bad intention, to call Jeſus Chriſt the greateſt ſinner in the World; becauſe the ſins of all God's People meet in him, and were imputed to him. They were his by a voluntary ſuſcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and undertaking: and if the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going expreſſion may be allowed, there is one in Heaven, the higheſt in Glory, whoſe ſins were never pardoned; for our Lord Chriſt paid down the utmoſt Farthing that either the <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God could exact, as a ſatisfaction for thoſe ſins that he voluntarily took upon himſelf: And therefore by <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,</hi> and not by <hi>free Grace,</hi> he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken poſſeſſion of Heaven for himſelf, and is there preparing Manſions for us. In reſpect of Chriſt we receive nothing of <hi>free Grace,</hi> or of <hi>free Gift,</hi> but all is by purchace. And as we our ſelves
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105935:180"/> are bought with a price; ſo is every thing we enjoy, even common and vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Mercies come flowing in upon us in ſtreams of bloud. Our Lives, and all the Comforts of them, much more our future Life, and all the means tending to it, are paid for by the Bloud of Chriſt. So that the Grace of God is not ſo <hi>free,</hi> as to exclude all merit on Chriſt's part, who hath purchaſed all we enjoy, or hope for, by paying a full and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble price to the Juſtice of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">God's Grace in giving of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to us, is free.</note> 
                     <hi>The infinite Grace of God in giving Chriſt to us, and his Bloud for us, through which we have pardon merited, is abſolutely free, and falls not under any merit, either of ours, or of his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, It falls not under any Merit of ours; for certainly, could we have me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited Chriſt out of Heaven, we might as well have merited Heaven without Chriſt. When God in his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom foreſaw how we would reject and deſpiſe his Son; firſt ſpill his Bloud, and then trample upon it, he did not account this Demeanour of ours to be meritorious of ſo great a gift.</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:105935:181"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Which is yet more to the Glory of <hi>God</hi>'s free Grace, <hi>He beſtowed Christ upon us, not only without any merit of ours, but without any merit of his alſo.</hi> It is free Grace that Pardons, that San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies, that ſaves us; yet all this Chriſt purchaſed for us by a full price. <hi>God</hi> will have a price paid down for all other things of a leſs value, that ſo he might hereby ſet forth his own Bounty in part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his own Son for us without price.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Pardoning Grace free in reſpect of us.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Pardon and Grace obtained through the Bloud of Chriſt, in reſpect of any Merit of ours, is altogether free and undeſerved.</hi> We cannot of our ſelves ſcarce ſo much as ask forgiveneſs, much leſs therefore can we do any thing that may deſerve it. All that we can do, is either ſinful, or holy; if what we do be ſinful, it only encreaſeth our Debts: If it be holy, it muſt proceed from <hi>God's free Grace,</hi> that enables us to do it; and certainly it is <hi>free Grace</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us upon the doing of that, which free Grace only enables us to do. Far be it from us to affirm, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:105935:181"/> do, that good Works are meritorious of pardon, what are our Prayers, our Sighs, our Tears? yea, what are our Lives and our Bloud it ſelf, ſhould we ſhed it for Chriſt? All this cannot make one blot in <hi>God</hi>'s Remembrance-Book: Yea, it were fitter and more becoming the infinite Bounty of <hi>God</hi> to give Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Heaven freely, than to ſet them to ſale for ſuch inconſiderable things as theſe are.</p>
                  <p>Heaven needed not to have been ſo needleſly prodigal and laviſhing, as to have ſent the Lord Jeſus Chriſt into the World to lead a miſerable Life, and die a curſed Death, had it been poſſible for Man to have bought off his own guilt, and to have quitted Scores with <hi>God</hi> by a lower price than what Chriſt himſelf could do, or ſuffer. And ſo much for the Reſolution of the <hi>firſt Queſtion: God</hi>'s pardoning Grace though it be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed in reſpect of Chriſt, yet is it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely free in reſpect of any merit of ours.</p>
                  <p>The Second <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, <hi>Whether the Grace of God be ſo free as to require no Conditions on our part.</hi> Of gifts, ſome
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:105935:182"/> are beſtowed abſolutely without any terms of Agreement. And ſome are Conditional upon the performance of ſuch Stipulations and Conditions, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they ſhall not be beſtowed; of which ſort is this Grace of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace is given abſolutely.</note>I Anſwer, Firſt, <hi>The Sanctifying and Regenerating Grace of God, whereby the great Change is wrought upon our Hearts, in our first Converſion and turning unto God, is given abſolutely, and depends not upon the performance of any Conditions.</hi> Indeed we are commanded to make uſe of means for the getting true and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace wrought in us; but theſe means are not Conditions for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of that Grace: For the Nature of Conditions are ſuch, that the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which depend upon them are never beſtowed, but where the Conditions are firſt performed. And therefore we call Faith and Repentance Conditions of Eternal Life, becauſe eternal Life is never confer'd upon any who did not firſt believe and repent. But now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, <hi>God</hi> hath converted ſome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of ordinary means, as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Thief on the Croſs.</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:105935:182"/> Therefore though we are commanded to uſe the means; yet the uſe of Means and Ordinances, cannot be called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of our Regeneration. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if any thing could be ſuppoſed a Condition of obtaining Grace, it muſt either be a work of Nature, or a work of Grace. Now a work of Grace it cannot be till Grace be wrought; and to go about to make a work of Nature a Condition of Grace, it is to go about to revive that old Errour of the <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> for which they ſtand Anathematized in <hi>Count Palleſtine</hi> many Years ſince. Sanctifying Grace is given freely, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted from any Conditions, though not excepted from the uſe of means.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Juſtifying and pardoning Grace, though it be free, yet is it limited to the performance of certain Conditions, without which God never beſtows it upon any, and they are two, Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> And theſe Graces God beſtows upon whom he pleaſeth, without any foregoing Conditions. Faith in Chriſt it is the freeſt gift that ever God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any, except that Chriſt on whom we believe. But pardon of ſin
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105935:183"/> is reſtrained to Faith and Repentance as the Conditions of it; nor is it ever obtained without them. Theſe two things the Scripture doth abundantly confirm to us. <hi>Whoever believeth on him, ſhall obtain remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Acts 10.43. <hi>Repent, that your ſins may be blotted out,</hi> Acts 3.19. <hi>Whoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves on him,</hi> there Faith is made the Condition of Pardon. <hi>Repent, that your ſins may be blotted out;</hi> there Repentance is made the Condition of Pardon. Theſe two particulars corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond with the two-fold Covenant of Grace <hi>God</hi> made with Man: His abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Covenant, wherein he promiſeth the firſt Converting Grace; this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant now is independent from any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, a Copy of which we have in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart alſo will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I will cauſe you to walk in my Statutes, and you ſhall keep my Judgments, and do them.</hi> And then there is <hi>God</hi>'s Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Covenant of Grace, wherein he promiſeth Salvation only upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Conditions of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, this we have, Mark 16.16. <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:105935:183"/>
                  <p>Thus I have ſtated the great <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> concerning the free Grace of <hi>God.</hi> The firſt Sanctifying Grace of <hi>God</hi> is ſo free as to exclude all Conditions; but the Juſtifying and Pardoning Grace of <hi>God</hi> is limited to the Conditions of Faith and Repentance; and both San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying and Juſtifying Grace are freely beſtowed without any Merit of ours, but not without reſpect to the Merit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed them at the higheſt rate, even with his own moſt precious Bloud.</p>
                  <p>In the next place I ſhall endeavour to ſet before you ſome particulars wherein the Glory of <hi>God</hi>'s free Grace in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning ſin may be more illuſtrated, that it may appear <hi>God</hi> aſſumes to himſelf this as the greateſt honour, to be a ſin-pardoning <hi>God.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>This highly commends the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of pardoning Grace, in that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to beſtow it without any Requeſt, or Entreaties of ours.</hi> There was no <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick</hi> moved him beſides the Yearnings of his own Bowels. This was a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reſolution ſprung up ſpontaneouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Heart of <hi>God</hi> from all eternity.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105935:184"/> He ſaw thee <hi>wallowing in thy Bloud,</hi> long before thou wert in thy Being: and this time it was a time of Love; even a time before all times: What Friend could'ſt thou then make in Heaven? What Interceſſour hadſt thou then, when there was nothing but God? When this deſign of Love was laid, there was neither Prayers nor Tongues to utter them: Yea, Chriſt himſelf, though now he intercedes for the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Pardon, did not then intercede for the Decree of Pardon; he could not then urge his Bloud and Merits as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for <hi>God</hi> to take up thoughts of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving us; for had not <hi>God</hi> done ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Chriſt had never ſhed his Bloud, nor wrought out Salvation for us. What Arguments, What Advocates did then perſwade him? Truly the only Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was our Miſery; and the only Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate was his own Mercy, and not Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons ſin, when he is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</note>Secondly, <hi>God pardons ſin, when yet he is infinitely able to deſtroy the ſinner;</hi> and this greatly advanceth the Riches and freeneſs of his Grace. The ſame breath that pronounceth a ſinner Abſolved,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:105935:184"/> might have pronounced him Damned. The <hi>Angels</hi> that fell could not ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the power and force of his Wrath, but like a mighty Torrent it ſwept them all into Perdition; How much leſs then could we ſtand before him? <hi>God</hi> could have blown away every ſinner in the World as ſo much looſe Duſt into Hell. It had been eaſie for his Power and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, if he had ſo pleaſed, to have tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd in the Deſtruction of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but only that he intended a higher and more noble Victory, even that his Mercy ſhould triumph and prevail over his Juſtice, in the pardoning and ſaving of ſinners.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, tho he might gain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, as on the Damned.</note> 
                     <hi>God pardons ſin though he might gain to himſelf a great Renown, as he hath on the Damned.</hi> God might have written thy Name in Hell, as he hath written theirs, and might have ſet thee up a flaming Monument, and inſcribed on thee Victory and Conqueſt to the Glory of his Everlaſting Vengeance. Both Books were open before him, both <hi>the Book of Life and of Death;</hi> and the Contents of both ſhall be rehearſed to his infinite Glory at the laſt Day: Now
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:105935:185"/> what was it dictated thy Name to him, that guided his Hand to write thee down rather in the <hi>Book of Life,</hi> than in the <hi>Book of Death;</hi> that ſet thee down a Saint, and not a Sinner; Pardon'd, and not Condemn'd? What moved him to do all this for thee? Why truly, the only Anſwer that <hi>God</hi> gives, and which is the only Anſwer that can be given, is the ſame which <hi>Pilate</hi> gives concerning our Saviour, <hi>What I have written, I have written.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Conſider the paucity and ſmallneſs of the number of thoſe that are pardon'd.</hi> Profeſſours of Chriſtianity are calculated by ſome to poſſeſs not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ſixth part of the known World; and if among them we make a proportionable abatement for thoſe that are <hi>profeſſed Idolaters,</hi> for the <hi>groſly ignorant,</hi> for the <hi>prophane,</hi> and the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical:</hi> Certainly there will be but a ſmall Flock remaining unto Jeſus Chriſt; here and there one pick't and cull'd out of the Multitudes of the World, like the <hi>Olive berries,</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks of, left <hi>on the top of the uppermoſt Branches,</hi> when the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:105935:185"/> hath ſhaken down all the reſt into Hell. Now is it not infinite Mercy, that thou ſhould'ſt be found among theſe Gleanings after Harveſt, that thou ſhoul'dſt be one of theſe few? God might have left thee to periſh upon the ſame Reaſon that he left others, but he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thee out of all Nations, Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, and Languages of the Earth, to make thee a <hi>Veſſel of Mercy</hi> for himſelf. Indeed thou canſt never enough admire the peculiar <hi>Love of God</hi> to thee herein, till the laſt Day; when thou ſhalt ſee the ſmall number of thoſe that are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſtanding on the Right Hand of Chriſt, compared with the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of thoſe that periſh ſtanding at the Left Hand of Chriſt, and ſeeſt thy ſelf among the ſmall number of thoſe that are ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>This alſo commends the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of pardoning Grace, that whereas the fallen Angels themſelves were abſolutely excepted out of God's Act of Indemnity and Oblivion; yet fallen Man is again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored unto his Favour.</hi> Them <hi>God</hi> hath reſerved in <hi>chains of darkneſs unto the Judgment of the great Day;</hi> us he hath

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105935:186"/> which we claim Kin to <hi>Angels,</hi> even they are of a younger Houſe, and of a more Ignoble Extract; how are they debaſed by being confined to theſe Lumps of Fleſh, which, with much adoe, they make a ſhift to drag with them up and down the Earth, rather as Fetters of their Bondage, than Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Service: nay, ſo low ſunk are we in this ſlime of matter, that we have not Excellency enough ſo much as to conceive what a pure Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Orient Subſtance a Spirit is. And yet ſuch as we are, Duſt and Filth, hath God gathered up into his own Boſome; though he hath disbanded whole Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Angels,</hi> and ſent them down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Hell.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Their Services would have been more perfect upon their reſtoration, than ours can be.</hi> Indeed when we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive

Had <hi>God</hi> reſtored them, and given them a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Heaven would more have reſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Shouts and Hallelujahs of one fallen <hi>Angel,</hi> than it can now with a whole <hi>Conſort of glorified Saints:</hi> They would have burnt much more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in Love, who now muſt burn much more fiercely in Torments. They would much more mightily and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſung forth the Praiſes of <hi>God</hi> their Redeemer; who now curſe and blaſpheme him more bitterly: And as far have out-ſtript a Saint in the work of Heaven, as they ſhall do a ſinner in the Puniſhment of Hell. And yet free Grace paſſeth by them, and elects and chuſeth narrower Hearts to conceive, and feebler Tongues to utter the Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their Redeemer; whoſe Praiſes ought therefore to be the more, becauſe he chuſeth not them that may give him the moſt.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:105935:187"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſider this, their ſins were fewer then ours are.</hi> We cannot exactly determine what their ſins were, only the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gives us a hint, that it was Pride gave them their fall, 1 Tim. 3.6. <hi>Not a Novice, leſt being lifted up with pride, he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil.</hi> Whether it was Pride, in that they affected to be <hi>God,</hi> or in that they ſcorn'd to be Guardians and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring Spirits unto Man, or in that they refuſed to become ſubject unto the <hi>Son of God,</hi> who was ſhortly to become Man, the <hi>Schools</hi> boldly enough di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute, but no Man can determine: but whatever it was, this is certain, <hi>God</hi> was ſpeedy in the execution of wrath upon them, tumbling them all down headlong into <hi>Hell</hi> upon their firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: The time of their ſtanding in their Primitive State, is conceived to be very ſhort; for their Creation, (though the <hi>Socinians</hi> hold, it was long before) muſt fall within the compaſs of ſix Days, for in that ſpace the <hi>Scripture</hi> tells us, <hi>God made Heaven and Earth, and all things therein:</hi> and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of ſix Days, he created the

                     <hi>Since God doth ſo freely pardon us, let this teach us, and prevail with us to pardon and forgive the offence of others.</hi> This is that the Scripture doth urge as the moſt natural Inference of this Doctrine of <hi>God</hi>'s pardoning Grace. Thus the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Epheſ. 4.32. <hi>Be ye kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, as God, for Chriſt's ſake, hath forgiven you.</hi> And ſay not as ignorant People are wont to do, <hi>I will forgive, but I will never forget;</hi> for <hi>God</hi> doth forgive, and forget too. <hi>I will blot out your tranſgreſſions, and I will remember your ſins no more.</hi> Your ſins againſt <hi>God</hi> are <hi>Talents,</hi> others Offences againſt you are but <hi>Pence;</hi> and if for every trivial Provocation you are ready to take your Brother by the Throat, and wreak your wrath and revenge upon him: may you not fear leſt your Lord and Maſter to whom you ſtand deeply indebted, ſhould alſo deal ſo with you for far greater Crimes, than others can be guilty of againſt you, and caſt you into Priſon until you have paid the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105935:195"/> moſt Farthing; eſpecially conſidering that you pray for the forgiveneſs of your own ſins, as you do proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly forgive the ſins of others. <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus I have opened and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated unto you the former part of the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> That the Grace of <hi>God</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he blots out and forgives ſin, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely free. I am now in the next place to prove, that it is infinitely <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this I ſhall endeavour to do by conſidering pardon of ſin in the Nature of it, in the Concomitants of it, and in the Effects and Conſequences of it: From all which it will appear, both how great a Mercy it is to us, and how great a Glory it is to <hi>God,</hi> that he blots out and forgets ſin. And,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Let us conſider the nature of pardon of ſin, what it is.</hi> And this we cannot better diſcover than by looking into the Nature of ſin. Sin therefore, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> deſcribes it, <hi>is a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:105935:195"/> of the Law.</hi> Now to the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of any Law, there are Penalties literally expreſſed, or tacitly implyed, which are altogether neceſſary. The guilt contracted by the tranſgreſſing of the Law, is nothing but our liableneſs to undergo the Penalty threatned in the Law, and this guilt it is two-fold; the one is intrinſical and neceſſary, and that is the deſert of puniſhment, which ſin carries always in it. The other is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſical and adventitious, by which ſin is ordained to be puniſhed. Theſe two things are in every ſin. Every ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves Death, and <hi>God</hi> hath in his Law ordain'd and threatned to inflict Death for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſtion.</hi> Now it being clear, That <hi>Pardon and Remiſſion of Sin,</hi> is nothing but the removal of the guilt of ſin; the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, <hi>Whether it removes that guilt that conſiſts in the deſert of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or that which conſiſts in the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary appointment of it unto puniſhment, or both?</hi>

                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To this, I Anſwer, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin</hi> doth not remove the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical deſert of puniſhment, but only the adventitious appointment and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of it unto puniſhment, flowing from the Will of <hi>God,</hi> who hath in his own <hi>Law</hi> threatned to puniſh ſin. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> doth not make that the ſins, even of Believers themſelves ſhould not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Death; for a liableneſs to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of the Law, in this ſence is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary conſequent upon the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Law: But becauſe <hi>God,</hi> in the Covenant of Grace, hath promiſed not to reward his Penitent Servants ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the evil of their doings, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pardoning Grace</hi> removes this guilt of ſin ariſing from <hi>God</hi>'s Ordination of it unto puniſhment. As now ſuppoſe a <hi>Traytour</hi> ſhould accept of the proffer of a Pardon, the guilt of his Treaſon cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not in the inward nature of it, but ſtill he deſerves to be puniſhed: but this Obnoxiouſneſs of his through the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's Favour and Appointment is taken away, and ſo that guilt ceaſeth. So the Repenting Sinner, every ſin he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits deſerves Death; but upon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105935:196"/> in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, this liableneſs unto Death ceaſeth, being graciouſly remitted to them by God.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſets forth this <hi>Pardon of ſin,</hi> in very ſweet and full Expreſſions. It is called a covering of ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Bleſſed is the man, whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> Though our covering of our ſins is no Security from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection of God's Eye, who clearly beholds the moſt hidden and ſecret things of Darkneſs; yet certainly thoſe ſins that God himſelf hath covered from himſelf, he will never again look into, ſo as to puniſh for them. Nay, yet farther, as a ground of Comfort, <hi>Pardon of ſin</hi> is not only called a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of our ſins from God's ſight, but a covering of God's Face and Sight from them; ſo we have it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.9. <hi>Hide thy face from my ſins, and blot out mine iniquities.</hi> It is a caſting of our ſins behind God's back, as a thing that ſhall never more be regarded or look'd upon: ſo it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to us, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 38.17. <hi>Thou haſt in love to my ſoul,</hi> (ſays good <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> when a Meſſage of Death was
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105935:197"/> brought to him by the Prophet) <hi>caſt all my ſins behind thy back.</hi> It is a caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them into the depth of the Sea; from whence they ſhall never more ariſe, either in this World, to terrifie our Conſciences; or in the World to come, to condemn our Souls; ſo we have it in <hi>Micah</hi> 1.19. <hi>I will caſt all their Iniquities,</hi> ſays God, <hi>into the depth of the Sea.</hi> It is a ſcattering of them as a thick cloud, ſo it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Eſay</hi> 44.22. <hi>I will ſcatter their ſins as a cloud, and their iniquities as a thick cloud.</hi> And in the <hi>Text,</hi> it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a blotting out and a forgetting of ſin. <hi>I even I am he that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins:</hi> a blotting out, to ſhew, That God will never read his Debt-Book againſt us; and a forgetting it, That we may not fear, that God will accuſe us without-book.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe, and ſuch like Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with which the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, do very much illuſtrate the Mercy of God, in pardoning of ſin, and I ſhall unfold it in theſe following Particulars.</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:105935:197"/>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Pardon and Remiſſion of ſin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pardon of ſin an Act of God's only.</note> 
                     <hi>is no Act of ours, but an Act of God's on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> It is nothing done by us, or in us, but an Act of God's free Grace, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without us, and therefore God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it wholly unto himſelf, <hi>I even I am he.</hi> And when our <hi>Saviour</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Paralytick,</hi> the <hi>Scribes</hi> ſtorm at him as a Blaſphemer, <hi>thou blaſphemeſt,</hi> ſay they to him, not knowing him to be God; <hi>for who,</hi> ſay they, <hi>can forgive ſins but God only?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But be it an Act of God's only, and not ours, and an Act wholly without us, what Comfort is there in this? yes much, and that upon theſe Grounds; becauſe God's Acts within us are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways imperfect in this Life, but God's Acts without us, are always perfect and conſummate. Sanctification is a work of God's Grace within us: Now this becauſe it meets with much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in every Faculty, from inherent ſin, which ſpreads it ſelf over the whole Soul; therefore this work is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in this Life kept low and weak. But <hi>Pardon of ſin,</hi> is an Act without us, in the breaſt of God himſelf, where
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:105935:198"/> it meets with no oppoſition nor allay nor doth it increaſe by ſmall degrees but is at once as perfect and intire, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ever it ſhall be. I do not mean, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſome have thought and taught, That God at once pardons all the ſins of true Believers, as well thoſe they do, or ſhal commit, as thoſe that they have already committed: but only, That what ſin God pardons, he doth not pardon then gradually. There is nothing left o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Guilt upon the Soul, when God par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dons it; but there is ſomething left o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Filth upon the Soul, when God ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies it. And therefore, as it is the grief of God's Children, That their inherent Holineſs is ſo imperfect here, that they are ſo aſſaulted with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, ſo dogg'd by Corruption, ſo oppreſſed and almoſt ſtifled to Death by a body of ſin that lies heavy upon them; yet this, on the other ſide, may be for their Comfort and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, That God's pardoning Grace is not as his ſanctifying Grace is, nor is it granted to them by the ſame ſtint and meaſure. A ſin truly repented of, is not pardoned to us by halves, half the Guilt remitted, and half retained, as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105935:198"/> the Papiſts fanſie to eſtabliſh their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Purgatory;</hi> but it is as fully pardon'd as it ſhall be in Heaven it ſelf: And hence it follows,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Though the Guilt of ſin be removed, yet it is not our Repentance that removes it: for then, as no Man's Repentance is abſolutely perfect; ſo no Man's Sins ſhould be fully pardon'd; but ſtill there would be remainders of Guilt left upon the Conſcience, as there is ſtill a mixture of Impenitency in the beſt Chriſtians: But Pardon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is not mingled with Guilt, as Grace is with Sin; becauſe it is an Act of Mercy wrought, not in our breaſt, but ariſing in God's only, where it meets with nothing to allay or abate it, and it is infinitely more perfect than our Repentance can be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Hence we may inferr,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pardon of Sin more ſure, than our Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it can be.</note> 
                     <hi>That our Pardon is infinitely more ſure, than our Aſſurance of it in our own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences can be ſatisfactory;</hi> for the ſenſe of Pardon is a work of God's Spirit within us, which commonly is mixed with ſome Heſitations, Miſ-givings,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:105935:199"/> Doubts and Fears: And therefore tho our Comforts be never ſo ſtrong, tho it be Spring-Tide with us; yet our ground for Comfort is ſtill much more Oh what rich and abundant Grace is this in God towards us, that exceeds both our Grace and our Comfort! And therefore though, O Chriſtian, thy Sanctification be the beſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of thy Juſtification and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, yet is it not the beſt Meaſure of it, for thou art juſtify'd and thou art pardon'd much more than thou art ſanctified; Sanctifying Grace in thee indeed is in its firſt Rudiments and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choation; but Pardoning-Grace in thy God, is conſummate and perfect. And that is the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Remiſſion of Sin, makes Sin to be as if it had never been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Things that are forgotten, are no more to us, than if they had never had a being. Now God tells us, he forgets our ſins, <hi>their ſins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</hi> Nor is there any long Tract of Time required, to wear the <hi>Idea</hi> of them out of his Memory, as is neceſſary among
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105935:199"/> Men, to make them forget the Wrongs and Injuries done to them by their fellow-Creatures; for God forgets the ſins of his Children, as ſoon as they are repented of; yea, ſometimes ſooner than our Conſciences do: for many times a Chriſtian, after a heart-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Repentance for ſome great Sin, lies under the upbraidings of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, when God hath forgiven it; yea, and forgotten it alſo. God's Officer is not ſo ready to acquit them, as God himſelf is. He forgets as though no Provocation or Offence had ever been committed. <hi>He retains not his Anger for ever,</hi> ſays the Prophet, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.14. not for ever, but ſo ſoon as ever we grow diſpleaſed with our ſelves, he begins to be well-pleaſed with us; no ſooner doth Sorrow and Grief over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread our Faces, but Favours and Smiles clear up his Face to us. See this gracious Diſpoſition of God, in <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.20. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is there brought in bewailing his ſin: <hi>Surely,</hi> ſays he, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I was turned, I repented; after I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my thigh; I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth:</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:105935:200"/> Now, what doth God but preſently embrace him, with moſt tender and moſt melting Expreſſions of Love, as if he had never been angry, nor had any cauſe for it: <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son, is he a pleaſant Child, ſince I paſs againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill; my bowels are troubled for him; I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And therefore, O Chriſtian, thou who now perhaps cryeſt out in the bitterneſs of thy Soul, Oh, that I had never committed this or that ſin againſt God! Oh, that I had never of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him in this or that manner! Why thou haſt thy Wiſh, O Sinner, herein; for God, when he pardons ſin, makes it as if it had never been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Remiſſion of Sin, makes God account of us as juſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</note>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> hence it follows, <hi>That upon Remiſſion of Sin, God no longer accounts of us as Sinners, but as Juſt and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> It is true, after a Pardon is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, we ſtill retain ſinful Natures; ſtill Original Corruption is in us, and will never totally be diſ-lodged out of us in this Life: but when God par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons us, he looks not upon us as Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:105935:200"/> but as Juſt and Righteous. A <hi>Malefactour,</hi> that is diſcharged, by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying the Law, or by the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Favour to him, is no more look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a <hi>Malefactour,</hi> but as Juſt and Righteous, as if he had never offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Law at all; ſo is it here: we are both ways diſcharged from our Guilt, by Satisfaction unto the Penalty of the Law in Chriſt our Surety, and by the free Grace and Mercy of God, who hath made and ſealed to us a gracious Act of Pardon in Chriſt's Blood; and therefore we ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in Law, and are as Juſt and Righteous in God's ſight, as if we had never ſinned againſt him. O how great Conſolation is here, unto the Children of God! They account themſelves great Sinners, yea, the greateſt and worſt of Sinners; but God accounts them Juſt and Righteous; they keep their ſins in remembrance, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>my ſin is ever before me;</hi> when God hath not only forgiven, but fot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten them: they write and ſpeak bitter things againſt themſelves, when God is writing out their Pardon, and ſetting his Seal unto it.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:105935:201"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">God's Grace as eaſily par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons great as ſmall ſins.</note>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Pardoning Grace can as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily triumph in the remitting of great and many Sins, as of few and ſmall Sins. What a great blot upon the Heavens is a thick Cloud, and yet the Beams of the Sun can pierce thorow that, and ſcatter it eaſily. Why now God will blot out our Trangreſſions as a thick Cloud, ſo himſelf tells us by the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.12. <hi>I will blot out thy tranſgreſſions as a cloud, and thine iniquities as a thick cloud.</hi> A great Debt may as eaſily be blotted out as a ſmall one. Ten thouſand Talents is a great Summ, yet it is as eaſily and freely forgiven, by the great God, as a few Pence. God proclaims himſelf, to be a God pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iniquity, Tranſgreſſion, and Sin; that is, Sins of all ſorts and ſizes. The greateſt Sins repented of, are no more without the Extent of Divine Grace and Mercy, than the leaſt Sins, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, are without the Cognizance of Divine Juſtice. <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.18. <hi>Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, yet ſhall they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as white as ſnow; though they be red as crimſon, yet they ſhall be as wooll.</hi> And can there then be found a <hi>deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:105935:201"/> Soul</hi> in the World, when the great God hath thus magnified his Grace and Mercy above all his Works, yea, and above all ours alſo? Say not then, <hi>O Sinner, my ſins are greater than can be forgiven;</hi> this is to ſtint and limit the Grace of God, which he hath made boundleſs and infinite: and thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, with as much Truth and Reaſon ſay, thou art greater than God, as that thy Sins are greater than his Mercy. Of all things in the World take heed that you be not injurious to this rich Grace, to this free Love and Mercy, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons thee even for his own ſake. God pardons thee for himſelf, for his own Sake, and doſt thou fear, O Penitent believing Soul, that ever he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee for thy Sins? no, but as much as God and his Mercy is greater than our Sins, ſo much more Reaſon will he find in himſelf to Pardon the Repenting Believing Sinner, than he can find Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in his Sins to condemn him.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee what cauſe of Comfort there is in this Pardoning Grace of God. And thus alſo we have conſider'd Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin in its own Nature.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:105935:202"/>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants</hi> of Pardon of ſin.</note>Secondly, <hi>We ſhall now conſider Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin in its Concomitants and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts,</hi> and ſo we ſhall take a view of thoſe things which do inſeparably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it, and thereby alſo we may ſee, how great and unſpeakable a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it is. It is a Mercy that is never beſtowed upon the Soul ſingly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but evermore comes environ'd with whole Troops and Aſſociate-Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. As,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Pardon of Sin, and Acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</note>Firſt, <hi>Pardon of Sin is always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd with the Acceptation of our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> Indeed theſe two are the twin Parts of our Juſtification; and therefore we have them coupled together, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.6, 7. <hi>He hath made us accepted in the beloved; In whom we have Redemption thorow his blood, even the Forgiveneſs of Sin.</hi> The whole Myſtery of our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſtands in theſe two things, Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Acceptation. Remiſſion takes away our liableneſs unto Death, and Acceptation gives us a Right and Title unto Life; for to be accepted of God in Chriſt, is no other, than for God through the Righteouſneſs and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:105935:202"/> of Chriſt imputed to us, to own and acknowledge us, as having a Right and Title unto Heaven: and therefore we have mention made of Pardon and an Inheritance together, as the full ſumm of our Juſtification. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.18. <hi>That they may receive forgiveneſs of ſin, and an inheritance among thoſe that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> It is not therefore, <hi>O Soul,</hi> a bare negative Mercy that God intends thee in the Pardon of thy Sins; it is not merely the removing of the Curſe and the Wrath that thy ſins have deſerv'd, though that alone can never be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently admired; but the ſame hand that plucks thee out of Hell, by pardoning Grace and Mercy, lifts thee up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by what it gives thee together with thy Pardon, even a Right and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the glorious Inheritance of the Saints above.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Another Concomitant is this,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pardoning and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> 
                     <hi>Who-ever God pardons, he doth alſo in ſome meaſure ſanctifie.</hi> He ſubdues our ſins, as well as blots them out; he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates their Power, as well as removes their Guilt. And indeed it were no better than loſt labour, for God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:105935:203"/> ſin, if he did not purifie the Sinner alſo: for, were but the leaſt Sin and Corruption left to rule and reign in us, we ſhould preſently run our ſelves as far into Debt and Arrears, as ever we were. Indeed the beſt Chriſtian, in whom Grace is moſt prevailing, and Corruption weakeſt, yet even he ſtands daily and hourly in need of pardoning Mercy; but yet withal, his Sins are not of ſo high a Nature, nor ſo deep a Stain, as uſually the Sins of wicked Men are. His Sins uſually are ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the manner of them, than for the matter of them: God, by his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Grace, forgives Infirmities, Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and Defects; and, by his ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace, ordinarily keeps him from the commiſſion of more groſs and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Sins. And how then can we enough admire the rich Grace of God, that not only forgives us our Debts, but withal beſtows a new ſtock upon us, to keep us from running into Debt again, in any great and deſperate Summs.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Pardon of Sin and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Pardon of ſin is always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd with our Adoption into the Family
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:105935:203"/> of Heaven.</hi> Herein is the Love of God greatly ſeen, not only to pardon <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,</hi> but to make them his Children: not only to forgive <hi>Debtors,</hi> but to make them <hi>Heirs</hi> of his own Eſtate. The ſame precious Blood that blots out our Sins, writes us down Heirs of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and Co-heirs with Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. O infinite and unſpeakable Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, thus richly and bountiful to give, as well as freely to forgive! that he ſhould thus inſtate us at preſent, in his Love and Favour, and hereafter inſtate us in his Glory! This is not the manner of Men, <hi>O Lord,</hi> but, <hi>as far as the Heavens are above the Earth, ſo far are the Thoughts of God above our Thoughts, and his Ways above our Ways:</hi> And therefore, <hi>as far as the Eaſt is from the West, ſo far hath he removed our Sins from us:</hi> And why ſo far? but only that he might make room for theſe great and unſpeakable Mercies of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, Sanctification, and Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to intervene.</p>

                     <hi>The ſending of Jeſus Chriſt into the World, who is the cauſe of all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto ſinful Man, was it ſelf the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this purpoſe of God, to pardon and forgive Sinners.</hi> It is very difficult to trace out the Order of the Divine De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees concerning the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and to paſs from one of them to another, as they lie ranked and metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dized in God's Breaſt: And divers that have attempted to ſearch out theſe <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana Dei,</hi> this Art and Myſtery of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Mercy, have trodden in paths different from one another, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs many of them differing from the Truth alſo. I ſhall not ſtand to draw a <hi>Scheme</hi> of theſe Decrees of God, let it now ſuffice us to know, that God, from all Eternity, foreſeeing the Sin and Miſery, which Man would, by his permiſſion, and his own ſin, involve himſelf in, did, for the manifeſtation of the Riches, both of his Mercy and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:105935:205"/> Juſtice, enter into Counſel, how to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſave him. This was the end of God's deſign, even to reſtore again to Happineſs ſome of Mankind; even as many as he ſhould ſelect out of the Maſs and common Rubbiſh of Sin and Miſery, and ſet apart for himſelf. Well, but how ſhall this end be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed and brought about: <hi>Juſtice</hi> brandiſheth its Sword in the Face of Sinners, and demands as great a ſhare of Glory in puniſhment, as <hi>Mercy</hi> doth in pardoning; and God is reſolved to glorifie both of theſe Attributes of his in their ſeveral demands: This now put him upon ranſacking of the deepeſt Counſel that ever lodged in his Heart, even of an Adored <hi>Mediatour,</hi> in whom <hi>Justice</hi> receives full ſatisfaction, and <hi>Mercy</hi> triumphs in a full Pardon, and both are infinitely glorious. For this end, God ſent down his Son from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Earth, to become a Propitiation for us, and ſo through the ſhedding of his Bloud to obtain remiſſion and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins for us. God's Mercy and his Beloved Son could not reſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Boſom, and therefore his purpoſe of pardoning Sin was ſo effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105935:205"/> that to make room for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing of his Mercy, he ſends his own Son out of Heaven, never to enter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain there, till by his Merit and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he had procured Remiſſion of Sins for all thoſe that believe in him. Hence the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Rom. 3.26. tells us, That <hi>God ſent forth Chriſt to be a Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through Faith in his Bloud, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of Sins that are paſt, through God's forbearance, that he might be Juſt, and the Juſtifier of them that believe in Jeſus.</hi> As if the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had ſaid, God could not be Juſt, if he ſhould juſtifie Sinners that deſerve his Wrath, unleſs he had ſent forth Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt into the World to become a <hi>Propitiation</hi> and Sacrifice to his Juſtice for their Sins: For having threatned in his unalterable word to inflict vengeance upon all that are guilty, his Truth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged him to this dreadful ſeverity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all, ſince all are guilty. But that Chriſt taking on him the guilt of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by his own undergoing the wrath of God, and the Curſe of the Law, hath ſo fully appeaſed Divine Juſtice, that now God, though he doth not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Sinners in themſelves, can yet be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:105935:206"/> Juſt and the Juſtifier of Sinners, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſent forth Chriſt to be a Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. God's Eternal Purpoſe to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie his Juſtice in the puniſhing ſin, and yet to glorifie his Grace and Mercy in pardoning Sinners, wrought this great effect of ſending Chriſt into the World, whereby two ſuch different ends might with Infinite Wiſdom be accompliſhed. So that Chriſt who is the cauſe of all our Happineſs and Mercy, is yet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the effect of God's Purpoſe and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to pardon ſin. And what can be ſaid more to advance the greatneſs of this Mercy, a Mercy ſo great, that one of the Fathers, St. <hi>Gregory</hi> by Name, doubted whether it were more Miſery or Happineſs that <hi>Adam</hi> fell, ſince his Sin and Fall occaſioned ſuch a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Redeemer, and ſuch a Glorious Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; <hi>Foelix culpa,</hi> ſays he, O Happy Fall, that obtained ſuch a Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Faith, the Effect of pardoning Mercy.</note>Secondly, <hi>Another bleſſed Effect of God's purpoſe in pardoning ſin, is the great gift of Faith.</hi> Indeed to give Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, were utterly in vain, did not God withal give Faith to accept him. To tender Chriſt to an Unbeliever, is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:105935:206"/> to offer a Gift where there is no Hand to receive it. Hence that <hi>God</hi>'s purpoſe of giving pardon might ſtand valid, that the Death of Chriſt might not be fruitleſs, and that his Bloud might not be like Water ſpilt on the ground, that cannot be gathered up again. <hi>God</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to beſtow Faith upon them that believe, that may convey to them the Benefits of Chriſt's Merits in their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Remiſſion. Theſe two bleſſed Effects now follow in <hi>God</hi>'s Purpoſe and Intention of pardoning ſin; even the Gift of Chriſt to procure, and the Gift of Faith to apply Pardon unto the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, And more eſpecially, <hi>Let us conſider Pardon of Sin in its temporal and real Application:</hi> And ſo the happy Effects of it are manifold, I ſhall only inſtance in ſome at preſent.</p>
                  <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">Pardon of ſin gives ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>God</hi>'s Juſtice.</note> 
                     <hi>Pardon of Sin gives an inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſecurity againſt the purſuits of aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtice.</hi> This is its formal, and moſt immediate Effect. Juſtice follows guilty Sinners cloſe at the Heels, and ſhakes its flaming Sword over their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:105935:207"/> Heads: every Threatning contained in this Book of <hi>God,</hi> ſtands ready charged againſt them, and their Sins make them ſo fair a Mark, that they cannot be miſſed. Hence is that ſad Complaint of <hi>Job, Why haſt thou ſet me up as a Mark?</hi> Into which he emptied his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows as into his Reins, <hi>Job</hi> 7.20. Now while Juſtice is driving the Sinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him from Plague to Plague, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never to ſtop till he hath driven him into Hell, the great Aſſembly and Meeting of all Plagues: Mercy inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth and lays its Arreſt upon it; and this Gracious <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Pardon</hi> reſcues us, though under the hands of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, and we ready to be turned into Hell. Here the Challenge that Juſtice makes to us ceaſeth, and we are left to walk ſafely under the protection of Mercy. For when <hi>God</hi> iſſues out a Pardon, he calls off Juſtice from its pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. Thus you have the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> thankfully acknowledging, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 85.2. <hi>Thou haſt forgiven our Iniquities;</hi> and what follows now, <hi>Thou haſt taken away all thy Wrath, thou haſt turned thy ſelf from the fierceneſs of thine Anger.</hi> Nor is it to be feared, O Soul, that thou
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:105935:207"/> ſhalt evermore be queſtioned for thoſe ſins that are once forgiven thee. <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Acts of Oblivion</hi> can never be repealed: No, <hi>God</hi> ſets an everlaſting Sanction upon them, and Juſtice ſhall never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain moleſt thee, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 34. <hi>I will forgive their iniquities, and will remember their ſins no more.</hi> And indeed, well may Divine Juſtice ceaſe its purſuit of the guilty ſinner, for always when <hi>God</hi> pardons a ſinner, he turns his purſuit after Chriſt, and ſatisfies all his juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands upon him: for though we are the Principals in the Debt, yet our <hi>Surety,</hi> who ſtands bound for us in the Covenant of Redemption, is far the more able and abſolving Perſon.</p>
                  <p>Now is not this an unſpeakable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that Juſtice and Vengeance, the heavy ſtroaks of which many thouſand Wretches lie under, and which thy ſins have provoked and armed againſt thy own Soul, that might, every ſin thou committeſt, that is every moment of thy Life, ſtrike thee Dead in the place; in the dread of which, if thou haſt any tenderneſs of Conſcience left in thee, thou muſt needs live in continual fearful expectations of this Wrath of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:105935:208"/> God, to deſtroy thee as his Enemy. Is it not now Infinite Mercy that God ſhould call in the Commiſſion given to his Juſtice, that Mercy might ſecure thee from it: What is this but the effect of Pardoning Grace that gives this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer charge to paſs over all thoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe Conſciences the Bloud of Chriſt is ſprinkled for the removal of their guilt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Peace and Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, an Effect of pardon of ſin.</note>Secondly, <hi>Another Bleſſed Effect of Pardon of Sin, is Peace and Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God.</hi> And what happineſs can there be greater, than when the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel betwixt Heaven and Earth, betwixt God and the Sinner, is taken up and compounded. Open Wars have been long proclaimed, and long maintained on either part; ever ſince the firſt great Rebellion, Man hath ſtood in defiance with, and exerciſed great Hoſtility a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Creatour; and <hi>God</hi> on the other hand, hath thundred out whole Peals of Curſes againſt theſe Rebels, and hath ſlain whole Generations of them eternally Dead upon the place. <hi>God</hi> hath ſtill maintain'd his Cauſe with Victory, and Man his with Obſtinacy;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:105935:208"/> and this War would never ceaſe, did not <hi>God</hi> proclaim Pardon and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all that will lay down their Arms and ſubmit. Now hereupon Peace is concluded fully: for firſt <hi>God</hi>'s pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners, manifeſts himſelf to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconciled to them, ſo the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, Rom. 5.1. <hi>Being Justified by Faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Christ. God</hi> is a ſworn Enemy to all guilty ſinners, himſelf hath affixed this Title to the reſt of his Name, <hi>That he will by no means clear the guilty.</hi> Guilt hath a malign influence, not only on our Conſciences to diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them with Terrours and Affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but on <hi>God</hi>'s Countenance alſo to ruffle it into Frowns and Diſpleaſure. Now when <hi>God</hi> pardons ſin, he wipes away this over-caſting Cloud: and the cauſe of Enmity being removed, his Face and Favour clears up to us. And then,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Pardon of Sin is a ſtrong Inducement to us to lay down the Weapons of our Warfare, and be at peace with God.</hi> What Argument can be more prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where there is any Principle of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity?
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:105935:209"/> When <hi>God</hi> thus proclaims Peace, ſhall I continue War? He Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and ſhall I Rebel? He is Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, and ſhall I be Implacable? Shall I perſiſt in thoſe ſins which he forgives? No, far be it from me: I ſubmit to that <hi>God,</hi> whoſe rich Grace conquers by condeſcending, as well as his Power by cruſhing. And thus the Soul lays down its Weapons at the Feet of <hi>God,</hi> and humbly embraceth the terms of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment propounded by him in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Pardon of ſin lays a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, for Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God.</note>Thirdly, <hi>Pardon of Sin lays a good Foundation for the Souls near Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Communion with God.</hi> Guilt is the only thing that breeds Alienation. <hi>Your Iniquities,</hi> ſays the Prophet, <hi>have ſeparated betwixt you and your God,</hi> Iſa. 59.2. Nor indeed is it poſſible that a guilty Sinner ſhould any more delight in Converſing with <hi>God,</hi> than a guilty Malefactour delights in the preſence of his <hi>Judge.</hi> And therefore we ſee when <hi>Adam</hi> had contracted guilt upon himſelf by eating the Forbidden Fruit, how childiſhly and fooliſhly doth he behave himſelf? <hi>God</hi> calls him, and he runs
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:105935:209"/> behind a Tree to hide himſelf; what a ſuddain change was here? <hi>Adam,</hi> who but a little before was his Creator's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, now dreads and ſhuns him; his guilt makes him apprehend <hi>God</hi>'s Call to be no other than a Summons to the Bar. Nor indeed can it be otherwiſe, but that guilt ſhould produce Aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt <hi>God</hi> and the Soul; for look how diſtance grows between two familiar Friends, ſo doth it here: If a Man be Conſcious to himſelf, that he hath done his Friend an Injury; what Influence hath this upon him? why, preſently it makes him more ſhy and reſerved to him than before. So is it here, Conſciouſneſs of guilt fills us with a troubleſome ill-natur'd ſhame; we are aſhamed to look <hi>God</hi> in the Face, whom we have ſo much wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our ſins. And <hi>Secondly</hi> this ſhame is always joyned with a ſlaviſh and baſe fear of <hi>God,</hi> leſt he ſhould Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf upon us, for the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that we have done to him; and both this Shame and Fear, takes off from that holy freedom and boldneſs, which reverently to uſe towards <hi>God,</hi> is the guſt and Spirit of our Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:105935:210"/> and Fellowſhip with him; and all theſe leſſen that ſweet Delight in <hi>God,</hi> that formerly we reliſht in the Intimacy of this Heavenly Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: And what can be the final pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of all this, but a moſt ſad Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and Eſtrangement between <hi>God</hi> and the Soul? But now Pardon of Sin removes theſe Obſtructions, and cauſeth the intercourſe betwixt <hi>God</hi> and the Soul to paſs free, becauſe it gives the Soul a Holy, and yet Awful Boldneſs in Converſing with the Great and Terrible Majeſty of <hi>God.</hi> So much ſence of Pardon and Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation as we have, ſo much boldneſs ſhall we have ordinarily in our Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to <hi>God.</hi> What's the Reaſon the Conſciences of Wicked Men drag them before <hi>God,</hi> and they come with ſo much Diffidence, Dejectedneſs, and Jealouſie? Why, it is, becauſe they are Conſcious to themſelves of guilt that lies upon them, and this makes them look on <hi>God</hi> rather under the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Judge, than of a Friend, or Father, and this makes them perform their Duties ſo diſtruſtfully, as if they would not have <hi>God</hi> take any notice
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:105935:210"/> that they were in his Preſence. But when a <hi>Pardon'd ſinner</hi> makes his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to <hi>God,</hi> he may do it with a Holy freedom, the Face of his Soul looks chearfully, and he Treats with <hi>God</hi> with an open Heart: What ground is there now for ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence as this is? For poor vile Duſt and Aſhes to appear thus before the great <hi>God</hi> of Heaven and Earth? Yes, there is; for Guilt is removed, his Peace is made in the Bloud of Chriſt, all Enmity is aboliſhed, all Quarrels are decided; and it becomes not him to ſerve <hi>God</hi> with ſuch Suſpiciouſneſs as Guilty Sinners do. Hence we have that Expreſſion of the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Heb. 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near to him in full Aſſurance of Faith, having our Hearts ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience,</hi> That is, from a Guilty and an Accuſing Conſcience: Now when the Heart and Conſcience is ſprinkled with the Bloud of Chriſt, whereby this Guilt is taken off, then hath a Man good ground to draw near to <hi>God,</hi> in full Aſſurance of Faith.</p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:105935:211"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Pardon of Sin lays a good ground for Peace in a Man's own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> I do not ſay that Peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is always an inſeparable Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant upon Pardon of Sin: For doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there are many ſo unhappy as to have a Wrangling Conſcience in their own Boſoms, when <hi>God</hi> is at Peace with them: But this is certain, That Pardon of Sin lays a ſolid ground and Foundation for Peace in a Man's own Conſcience, and were Chriſtians but as induſtrious as they ſhould be in clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Evidences for Heaven, they might obtain Peace whenever they are pardon'd. What is there that diſquiets Conſcience, but only Guilt? nothing but the Guilt of Sin doth it; this is that which rageth and ſtormeth in Wicked Men, and is as a Tempeſt within their Breaſts; this is that <hi>unſeen Scourge</hi> that draws Bloud and Groans at every Laſh; this is that <hi>Worm</hi> that lies perpetually gnawing at the Heart of a Sinner; this is that Rack that breaks the Bones, and disjoynts the Soul it ſelf. In a word, Guilt is the Fuel of Hell, and the Incendiary of Conſcience: were
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:105935:211"/> it not for Guilt, there were not a more pleaſant and peaceable thing in all the World, than a Man's own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Now Pardon of Sin removes this Guilt, and thereby makes Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation between us and our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and therefore, ſays our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.2. to the <hi>Paralytick</hi> Man, <hi>Son, be of good chear, thy Sins are forgiven thee;</hi> why might not ſome ſay, this is an Impertinent Speech, to ſay to one that was brought to be cured of a ſad Infirmity of Body, <hi>That his Sins were forgiven him,</hi> whilſt yet his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe was not cured? Not but our Lord Chriſt knew, that there was infinitely more cauſe of Joy and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to have Sin Pardon'd, than to have Diſeaſes cured. To have all calm and ſerene within, not to have a Frown, or Wrinkle upon the Face of the Soul, to have all ſmooth Thoughts and peaceful Affections; this is ſome faint reſemblance of Heaven it ſelf, and is never vouchſaft unto any, but where Pardon and the ſence of it is given to the Soul.</p>

                     </hi> A Diſeaſe then becomes a Medicine, when <hi>Pardon</hi> hath taken away the Curſe and Puniſhment of it. <hi>God</hi> hath two ends with reſpect of himſelf for which he brings Puniſhments upon us, the one is the Manifeſtation of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, the other is for the ſatisfaction of his Juſtice. And accordingly, as any Affliction tends to either of theſe ends,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:105935:212"/> ſo is it properly a Puniſhment, or barely a Fatherly Chaſtiſement. If <hi>God</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by the Afflictions he lays upon thee, the ſatisfaction of his Juſtice, then thy Afflictions are properly Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and they flow from the Curſe of the Law, but if the manifeſtation of his Holineſs be all he intends by them, then are they only Fatherly Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections proceeding from Love and Mercy.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Thoſe whoſe ſins God hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, he may afflict for the declaration of his Holineſs,</hi> that they may ſee, and know what a Holy God they have to deal with; who ſo perfectly hates ſin, that he will follow it with Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments even upon thoſe whom his free Grace hath pardon'd.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God inflicts no Chastiſements upon thoſe whom he hath pardon'd, for the ſatisfaction of his Juſtice:</hi> and therefore they are not Curſes, nor properly Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, but only Corrections and Fatherly Chaſtiſements. Chriſt hath ſatisfied the demands of Juſtice for their Sins, and <hi>God</hi> is more juſt, than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:105935:213"/> double ſatisfaction for the ſame Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, one in Chriſt's Puniſhment, and another in theirs. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath Redeemed us from the Curſe of the Law, being made a Curſe for us.</hi> It is not the Evils that we ſuffer, that makes them Curſes, or Puniſhments, be they never ſo great; but only the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of theſe Evils to the ſatisfaction of Divine Juſtice upon us. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt in <hi>Scripture</hi> is ſaid to be made a Curſe, not ſimply becauſe he ſuffered, but becauſe he was adjudged to his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, that thereby ſatisfaction might be made unto the Juſtice of <hi>God.</hi> Hence therefore with what calmneſs and peace may a <hi>Pardoned Sinner</hi> look upon any Afflictions, though they are ſore and heavy, tho they ſeem to carry much of <hi>God</hi>'s Anger in them; yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Curſe, or of the nature of a Puniſhment; the Sting was all of it received into the Body of Chriſt, and now <hi>God</hi>'s Righteouſneſs will not ſuffer him to puniſh them again in their own Perſons, whom he hath already puniſht in their Surety. Imagine what Affliction thou canſt. Art thou pinched with Want and Poverty? Doeſt thou ſuſtain
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:105935:213"/> Loſſes in thy Eſtate, in thy Relations? Art thou tormented with Pains, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Diſeaſes, and will all theſe bring Death upon thee at the laſt? Yet, O Soul, if thy Sins are Pardon'd, here is nothing of a Curſe, or Puniſhment in all this, Juſtice is already ſatisfied by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s bearing the Curſe of the Law for thee; Come what will come, it ſhall not hurt thee; Afflictions are all weak and weaponleſs, they are only the Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a Loving Father, for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his Holineſs, and for thy Eternal Gain and Advantage. Very ſad is the Condition of <hi>Guilty Sinners,</hi> for whether they know it or not, there is not the leaſt Affliction, not the leaſt Gripe or Pain, not the leaſt ſlight, or inconſiderable Croſs, but it is a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted by <hi>God,</hi> upon them, for the Guilt of their Sins; <hi>God</hi> is now a beginning to ſatisfie his Juſtice, and theſe are ſent by him to Arreſt and Seize on them; he now begins to take them by the Throat, and calls upon them to pay him what they owe him. Every Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them is part of Payment, and is exacted from them as part of Payment. O the vaſt and infinite Sums of Plagues
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:105935:214"/> that <hi>God</hi> will moſt ſeverely exact from them in Hell, where they ſhall pay to the utmoſt Farthing. There is not the leaſt Calamity that befals Wicked and Unpardon'd Sinners, but carries the Venom of a Curſe in it, and is inflicted by <hi>God</hi> upon them in order to the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his Juſtice on them: which compleat ſatisfaction he will work out upon them in their Compleat Torments in <hi>Hell.</hi> So much for this Time and Text.</p>
